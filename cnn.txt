 Live Russia's war in Ukraine Live House Jan. 6 committee report  By Eliza Mackintosh, Jack Guy, Rhea Mogul, Aditi Sangal and Leinz Vales, CNN Our live coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine has moved here. From CNN's Phil Mattingly   US President Joe Biden will announce an additional $1.8 billion in security assistance to Ukraine during President Volodymyr Zelensky’s expected visit the White House.  The significant boost in aid is expected to be headlined by the Patriot missile defense systems that are included the package, a US official told CNN.  The new announcement will add to the nearly $20 billion in US security assistance provided to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February, and will come at the same moment US lawmakers are considering a sweeping government spending measure that includes an additional $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine.  Patriot missile defense systems: Ukraine has been calling for the US to send the advanced long-range air defense system that is highly effective at intercepting ballistic and cruise missiles as it comes under a barrage of Russian missile and drone attacks that have destroyed key infrastructure across the country.  It would be the most effective long-range defensive weapons system sent to the country and officials say it will help secure airspace for NATO nations in eastern Europe. Previously, the US has sent Patriot batteries to NATO allies like Poland as a way to bolster their defenses, and sent other weapon systems to Ukraine to assist against the Russian invasion. From CNN's  Sean Lyngaas A Kremlin-linked hacking group known for focusing on Ukraine has stepped up its spying efforts against Ukraine's NATO allies in recent months — in part by trying to hack a big oil firm in a NATO country in August, according to US cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks. It's the latest sign that Russia's various hacking teams are throwing out all the stops to try to get key intelligence on NATO members as Moscow tries to shift the tide of its bloody war in Ukraine. The hacking group — which Ukraine has accused of working out of Crimea on behalf of Russian intelligence — unsuccessfully tried to break into the network of an oil refinery company based in a NATO country "that continues to import oil from Russia," Unit 42, Palo Alto Networks' threat intelligence group, told CNN on Tuesday.  Unit 42 declined to name the NATO country or the oil firm. Data held by the oil firm could, in theory, be helpful to Russia as it deals with a slew of Western sanctions that followed its February full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The hackers' "shift in targeting represents a significant expansion of their mission," said Jen Miller-Osborn, Unit 42's director of threat intelligence.  Throughout the war in Ukraine, Russian operatives — and those from other governments — have tried to use hacking to understand what's going on and off the battlefield, according to US officials and private researchers. Multiple examples of that type of cyber-espionage against non-Ukrainian targets have spilled into the public eye in recent weeks. Another set of suspected Russian hackers, for examples, tried to break into six military, technology or logistics firms in the US and Europe that do work with Ukraine, French cybersecurity firm Sekoia.io reported this month.  The hacking operations typically involve deception and subterfuge. The Russia-linked hackers tracked by Unit 42 tried to cover their tracks by changing up the internet protocol (IP) addresses — the unique numbers that identify computers online — they used in their operations. In one case, the hackers made it appear as if their activity was coming from an IP address owned by the Pentagon.  The Pentagon has been heavily involved in trying to help Ukraine defend itself from Russian cyber operations for the last year. Cyber Command – the US military's offensive and defensive hacking unit — sent teams of personnel to Ukraine to study Russian hacking tools in advance of the Russian invasion. US and Ukrainian officials have shared thousands of dataset of malicious cyber activity with each other to bolster defenses during that time, according to Cyber Command. From Phil Mattingly   Planning is underway for President Joe Biden to welcome Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House Wednesday. The surprise visit will coincide with the administration’s intent of sending a new defense assistance package that will include Patriot missile systems, according to two sources familiar with the planning.  The visit, which hasn’t been finalized and has remained tightly held due to security concerns, would mark Zelensky’s first trip outside Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in February.  The White House declined to comment on a potential visit, a Biden announcement or new security assistance announcements. From CNN's Uliana Pavlova and Radina Gigova Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday issued instructions for the creation of a so-called working group that would coordinate between various authorities issues related to mobilization preparation and mobilization, according to a statement by the Kremlin.  Putin issued instructions "to form a working group to ensure the interaction of public authorities and organizations on issues of mobilization training and mobilization, social and legal protection of Russian citizens participating in a special military operation, and their families," the statement reads.  On Nov. 25, Putin met with mothers of soldiers fighting in Ukraine and promised them to look into reports about irregularities related to training, food supplies and lack of proper uniforms for soldiers fighting in what Russia calls its "special military operation." On Oct. 31, Russia's Defense Ministry announced that its “partial mobilization” of hundreds of thousands of citizens to fight in the country’s war on Ukraine has been completed. The ministry said that all partial mobilization activities had been suspended, along with “all activities related to conscription for military service.” Russia's “partial mobilization” announcement sparked, at the time, protests and an exodus of men from the country.  From CNN staff Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the frontline city of Bakhmut Tuesday, where Ukrainian and Russian forces have been locked in a brutal battle for months. Here are some of the latest headlines: From CNN's Radina Gigova and Josh Pennington  Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the "headquarters" of what Russia calls its "special military operation" last week, Russian state media reported Tuesday quoting the Kremlin, without providing a specific location for the visit.  Putin visited the Russian military "headquarters" of the so-called "special military operation" zone on December 16, Russian state news agency TASS reported, referencing reporting by Russian outlet Rossiyskaya Gazeta, which quotes Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.  However, it remains unclear where those so-called "headquarters" were situated. Video released by Russian state outlet Ruptly showed Putin in a business suit, meeting with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and others in a conference room. Earlier on Tuesday, Russian State Duma lawmaker Andrei Gurulev wrote on his Telegram channel that the Supreme Commander of the Russian Armed Forces [Putin] was in the zone of the "special military operation."  "If he [Gurulev] means the headquarters where he [Putin] was on Friday, then yes," Peskov said, answering a question about Putin's visit, according to TASS referencing Rossiyskaya Gazeta, without saying where the "headquarters" was. Peskov had told reporters that Putin worked all day on Friday at the "joint headquarters of the military branches involved in the special military operation," according to TASS. During the visit, Putin got familiar with the work of the headquarters, received a report on the progress of the operation, held a conference and separate meetings with the commanders, and listened to the proposals of military leaders regarding the immediate and medium-term actions of the military, according to TASS.  The reporting by Russian state media about Putin visiting Russian military "headquarters" follows a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier Tuesday to the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, which has become the epicenter of Russian efforts to take territory.  From Julia Kesaieva Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was struck by the state of cities and towns he passed through on the way to the front lines in Bakhmut on Tuesday. Zelensky went to Bakhmut, the epicenter of fighting in Donetsk region, to meet troops and present medals. "I was there today to support our soldiers, to present state awards, to thank them," he said in his daily video message. "I have passed Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, Druzhkivka, Konstantinovka... Cities, villages nearby, which are now literally struggling for life." He said Ukrainian heroes in Bakhmut would stop the "so-called Russian world." "We will do everything possible and impossible, expected and unexpected, so that our heroes have everything they need to win," Zelensky said, naming front line settlements in Donetsk and Luhansk.  "This is our Luhansk region, this is our south of Ukraine, this is our Crimea. Ukraine will not leave anything of its own to the enemy." From CNN's Tim Lister and Julia Kesaieva  President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to Ukrainian troops on the front lines in Bakhmut comes us Russian forces intensify their efforts to break Ukrainian resistance in several parts of Donetsk region. With the conflict now exactly 300 days old, the Russians have been pushing some of their newly mobilized troops into fierce battles in both Luhansk and Donetsk, but the Ukrainian military consistently reports that Russian assaults have been rebuffed. On Tuesday, the military's General Staff said: "The enemy continues to focus its efforts on conducting offensive actions in the Bakhmut and Avdiivka directions," both in Donetsk. The Russians were trying to recover ground lost in September along the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk, it said. They were also intensifying assaults immediately to the west of the city of Donetsk, the General Staff said.    Much of the Russian fire comes from multiple rocket launchers. The Ukrainian General Staff said the Russians had carried out more than 80 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) attacks on Monday alone. Some of the most intense fighting has been in and around the ruined town of Mariinka, which the Russians are trying to secure to give them a foothold for further offensive action. The General Staff said that on Tuesday, "the enemy continues to conduct offensive actions, fired from tanks and all types of artillery at the positions of our troops in the areas of 24 settlements."  Ukraine said its air defenses had brought down two Mi-8 helicopters. Neither side has made decisive gains in the east since the Ukrainians' lightning offensive in September, partly because of wet weather, fog and mud but also because much of the front lines is heavily mined. Russian forces are on the eastern fringes of Bakhmut, according to geolocated video, but one Russian military blogger said Monday that Russian units of the Wagner group had lost some ground south of the city. It is difficult to confirm territorial changes around Bakhmut.   Further north, on the border of Luhansk and Kharkiv regions, the Ukrainian military says it has beaten back "small counterattacks" by Russian forces. Serhiy Hayday, head of Luhansk region military administration, said the Russians continued to shell recently liberated areas.  "Now that it's getting colder and the ground is getting firmer, most probably the hostilities may become more active in the near future, as it will be easier for the equipment to move. Anyway, we do expect that some changes may come on this direction.  Please enable JavaScript for a better experience.

      Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee set to release Trumpâs taxes in the coming days
    
**************************
 
      The Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee said Tuesday it would release former President Donald Trump's tax returns within days and asserted that the IRS failed to properly audit the former president's taxes while he was in office.
   
      The committee also released a report Tuesday that detailed six years' worth of the former president's tax returns, including his claims of massive annual losses that significantly reduced his tax burden.
   
      Chairman Richard Neal and fellow Democrats said Tuesday that the records they obtained showed that the presidential audit program failed to work as intended. The Massachusetts Democrat charged that the required audit of Trump's taxes "did not occur," as his returns were only subjected to the mandatory audit once, in 2019, after Democrats inquired. 
   
      "The research that was done as it relates to the mandatory audit program was nonexistent," Neal told reporters after the committee hearing. 
   
      The committee also released a supplemental report from the Joint Committee on Taxation that included details on Trump's tax returns from 2015 to 2020, ahead of the planned release of the returns themselves.
   
      
      READ: The House Ways and Means Committee's summary report on Donald Trump's taxes
     
      Those underlying documents, however, will need to undergo significant redactions first. 
   
      The release of Trump's tax returns marks the conclusion of a nearly four-year legal battle House Democrats waged against the former president after they took control of the House in 2019. 
   
      The audit program was important to Democrats because it was the justification they used to obtain the returns in the first place â but the Democratic pursuit was also tied in part to long-held suspicions about Trump's taxes after he would not release his returns while running for president in 2016 or once in office.
   
      The committee also made legislative recommendations to bolster the presidential audit program, including new requirements "for the mandatory examination of the President with disclosure of certain audit information and related returns in a timely manner." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday evening that the House would "move swiftly" to advance the legislation, even though Congress is days away from adjourning.
   
      In a separate report, the Joint Committee on Taxation offered a summary of its review of tax returns between 2015 and 2020 for Trump and several of his businesses. The JCT noted in its report it had no investigatory power â it couldn't demand documents from Trump or his businesses or interview IRS agents assigned to Trump's audits â so the committee issued no opinion about whether Trump should have paid more or less taxes. 
   
      Trump reported a stunning reversal of fortune during the middle two years of his presidency that led to a considerable tax bill, according to the report from the Joint Committee on Taxation. The $1.1 million paid in federal taxes in 2018 and 2019 stand in stark contrast to the $750 he paid in 2017 and $0 in 2020.
   
      Trump's tax bill grew substantially as his income surged in 2018 and 2019. Trump reported a $22 million capital gain in 2018 and a $9 million gain in 2019 from asset sales, sending his income into the black following years of enormous losses.
   
      In 2015 and 2016, Trump reported he lost more than $32 million each year. In 2017, Trump said he lost nearly $13 million. But he reported taxable income of $24 million in 2018 and more than $4 million in 2019, giving him a sizeable tax bill.
   
      However, in 2020, as the pandemic hit, Trump once again reported a gigantic loss of nearly $5 million. He paid $0 in federal income taxes that year.
   
      Evident in tax information broken out in the Joint Committee on Taxation report on Trump's tax returns from 2015-2020 is Trump's pattern â as previously shown by a New York Times investigation â of generating huge net operating losses and then carrying them forward for years afterward to zero out his tax liabilities. For instance, the JCT noted that Trump carried forward $105 million in losses on his 2015 return, $73 million in 2016, $45 million in 2017 and $23 million in 2018.
   
      
      Supreme Court allows House committee to get Trump's tax returns
     
      A spokesperson for Trump accused House Democrats of playing politics for moving to release his tax returns to the public.
   
      "This unprecedented leak by lameduck Democrats is proof they are playing a political game they are losing," said Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung.
   
      He added, "If this injustice can happen to President Trump, it can happen to all Americans without cause."
   
      The Ways and Means Committee report concluded that the IRS failed to audit Trump's taxes as required under the mandatory presidential audit program. The report found that Trump was only audited one year from 2015-2020. "The Committee's investigation revealed only one mandatory audit was started under the prior Administration and the program was otherwise dormant, at best," the committee wrote in its 25-page report released Tuesday after the committee hearing.
   
      The committee found that the IRS was under-resourced to handle the presidential audit program, recommending additional staffing including "two senior IRS agents, a partnership specialist, a foreign specialist, and a financial products specialist." 
   
      Neal also wouldn't say if he saw any red flags in Trump's taxes â either on his business or personal filings. "I think we need to leave that to the tax folks," he said.
   
      Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the committee, attacked Democrats for weaponizing Trump's financial information. Brady said that the committee voted to release Trump's returns for six years, along with returns from eight affiliated businesses. 
   
      "What became clear is that almost all those audits that the IRS is doing is not yet complete. So any characterizations of the returns themselves, you have to acknowledge, this is incomplete at this time," Brady said.
   
      The highly anticipated meeting, which began publicly but quickly entered into a closed, private session, was years in the making but comes as Democrats have just days to act on whether to release the former president's tax returns. While there is historic precedent for Ways and Means to release confidential tax information, a decision to put it out to the public comes with intense political fallout as Trump has already declared he is running for president in 2024. 
   
      The committee has had access to Trump's taxes for weeks after winning a lengthy legal battle that began in the spring of 2019. Neal requested the first six years of Trump's taxes as well as tax returns for eight of his businesses back in April of 2019. 
   
      Brady, the panel's top Republican, told reporters just before Tuesday's meeting that releasing Trump's tax returns would amount to "a dangerous new political weapon that reaches far beyond the former president and overturns decades of privacy protections for average Americans that have existed since the Watergate reform."
   
      "We are unified in our concern the Democrats may today move forward with unprecedented action that will jeopardize the right of every American to be protected from political targeting by Congress," Brady said.
   
      Democrats on the committee would rely on section 6103 of the tax code to lawfully release information about Trump's taxes, but Republicans are prepared to argue that Democrats are abusing the provision, attacking a political enemy and potentially unleashing a system where even individuals could have their personal information exposed if they become targets of the committee.
   
      The Joint Committee on Taxation also raised many questions about the validity of Trump's claims in his tax returns.
   
      For example, Trump included many gigantic tax deductions for charitable donations that the JCT said merited further investigation.
   
      
      Hear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump
     
      In 2015, Trump claimed a $21.1 million deduction for donating 158 acres of his 212-acre property called Seven Springs in North Castle, New York. The donation is included in the Manhattan district attorney's criminal investigation of the Trump Organization's finances.
   
      The report noted that an IRS agent assigned to audit Trump's taxes suggested disallowing the entire $21.1 million deduction because Trump did not get a qualified appraisal for the land. The agent alternatively suggested reducing the value of the deduction by more than half and said the appraiser may be subject to a fine for potentially misstating the value of the land.
   
      In 2016 and 2017, Trump claimed nearly $1.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, in charitable contributions, the bulk of which were made in cash. Trump had no taxable income in either year, but he was able to carry forward the deduction to future years, further limiting the amount of federal income tax he had to pay. The JCT said the large cash contributions merited a review.
   
      Trump had taxable income in 2018 and 2019 and reported cash donations of just over $500,000 each year. That means he was able to claim a charitable contribution deduction those years. The JCT suggested Trump should be asked to substantiate those large cash donations.
   
      When Neal requested Trump's tax information in 2019, he wasn't the first chairman to use an arcane section of the tax code known as 6013 to glean confidential tax information. The same statute has been used a number of times by Ways and Means chairmen for investigations and the Joint Committee on Taxation also used the statute to obtain information about former President Richard Nixon's taxes in the 1970s. 
   
      According to the House Ways and Means Committee, that information was requested and received without a legal fight. Nixon had voluntarily released some of his returns, but JCT requested additional returns using 6103, according to a House Ways and Means Committee memo released earlier this summer. Republicans have also used the 6103 statute. Back in 2014, Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp led the committee in releasing confidential tax information to further the committee's investigation into whether the IRS had unfairly targeted conservative organizations when deciding on groups to probe.
   
      Although The New York Times obtained decades of Trump's personal tax information back in 2020, Neal's request could shed light on additional years of Trump's finances and paint a picture of how the former president used his business entities and personal wealth in the years before and after becoming president. 
   
      Trump broke with tradition in 2016 by refusing to release any of his personal tax returns. 
   
      Democrats have long argued that Trump's taxes could provide necessary information about whether the president had any entanglements that could impact his decision making as president. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee argued in court they needed Trump's tax returns so they could understand better the presidential audit program, which is supposed to routinely audit the returns of every incoming president and vice president when they are elected. 
   
      Neal didn't just request Trump's raw tax return, however. Neal also requested administrative files and paperwork, items that could include IRS officials' notes or audits of Trump's returns. The information could paint a picture of what kind of scrutiny the IRS has pursued on Trump in the past and whether any of that scrutiny changed when he became president. 
   
      When the returns are made public, they could shed light on how wealthy Trump really is, how much he gave to charity and how much he paid in taxes. The New York Times report in 2020 made clear that Trump carried over business losses for years to legally be able to avoid paying taxes for many of those years, but Ways and Means will have access to some additional years of Trump taxes as well.

      Britain is being hit by a wave of strikes. How did things get so bad?
    
**************************
 
      Another day, another round of strikes in Britain. 
   
      As the Christmas holidays approach, railway workers have brought the transport network to a standstill. Border Force staff are preparing to walk out. Postal workers, bus drivers and civil servants are either in the middle of strike action or threatening to strike.
   
      This week, nurses staged their biggest walkout in decades. And on Wednesday, paramedics are on strike in many parts of England, in a particularly bitter dispute that will bring further turmoil to an already ravaged public health system.
   
      The public have been urged to only call ambulances if they absolutely need to. âDon't get so drunk that you end up with an unnecessary visit to A&E," Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, told the BBC.
   
      But Wednesday's strike heaps further pressure on the government, which has been accused of disregarding the calls of workers. Health Secretary Steve Barclay told the Daily Telegraph that ambulance workers have "taken a conscious choice to inflict harm on patients," comments that drew the ire of workers and unions.
   
      A collection of individual disputes across various sectors have coalesced into a broader sense that something has gone very wrong in Britain, with workers saying that their pay, conditions and ability to provide essential services have been compromised by years of cuts and underinvestment.
   
      How have things got to such a nadir?
   
      Thursday's strike by ambulance workers, who are demanding a pay rise in line with inflation, comes after thousands of nurses walked out on 15 and 20 December.
   
      It is not just health and emergency services that are affected; virtually all forms of travel have been affected in some ways by strike or are expected to be in coming weeks â along with education, the criminal justice system, the postal service and a host of other fields. 
   
      Each workforce has complaints specific to their sectors that have brought them to the picket line. But the wave of strikes must also be viewed in light of the UK's long-running economic and societal stagnation, which has left workers desperate for a better deal.
   
      A cost of living crisis and soaring inflation have left Britons worse off this year. When adjusted for inflation, wages in the UK have fallen at one of the sharpest rates since records began in 2001, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). 
   
      And Britain's public sector workers in particular are bearing the brunt; average pay growth in the private sector was 6.9% in the middle of 2022, compared to 2.7% for the public sector â the ONS said this gulf is "among the largest differences between the private sector and public sector growth rates we have seen."
   
      Still, for many striking workers, anger can be traced back further than the current economic crises.
   
      Since former Prime Minister David Cameron's austerity program saw budgets for public services slashed, employees have complained of a decline in many of Britain's local agencies and institutional safety nets.
   
      Funding for local councils and schools slumped over the course of the 2010s, a decade of decline that critics say has held Britain back, leaving a gaping wound in the services parents, children and citizens rely on every day.
   
      The aftershocks of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic further tightened the purse-strings and complicated a cautious effort to emerge from the tight-fisted approach that defined the 2010s. 
   
      More recently, instability at the heart of government â Britain is on its fifth Prime Minister in six years â and a disastrous financial program unveiled by shambolic ex-PM Liz Truss have dashed many Brits' hopes that the public sector will get a boost in the near future.
   
      Strikes in the National Health Service â a pillar of Britain's national identity and one of the world's most lauded governmental programs â are rare.
   
      Until this month, the UK's largest nursing union had never called a walkout in its 106-year history. Wednesday's ambulance strike is the first such action since 1990.
   
      There are some concerns about the level of service that will continue during the strike. Members of the armed forces are being deployed in an effort to relieve the impact, and health minister Will Quince suggested on BBC Radio that people should avoid contact sport or other "risky activity" while ambulance services are disrupted, comments that were roundly criticized as flippant. 
   
      
      British nurses launch historic strike, as pay and staffing crises threaten the NHS
     
      But workers in the NHS have been pushed to the brink in recent years, with a staffing crisis, low pay and skyrocketing waiting lists leaving hospitals and wards crammed full and staff exhausted.
   
      Brits must now wait an average of one hour for an ambulance if they've reported a suspected heart attack, stroke or other similar issues, despite an 18-minute national target. The wait for a "Category 1" call, which relates to immediate threats to life, is up to 10 minutes, despite a seven-minute target. 
   
      Conditions do not always improve while a patient arrives in hospital, where waiting times are at record levels. Every day, across the country, ambulances can be seen lined up outside emergency departments, waiting to discharge their patients.
   
      In the West Midlands area of England, one person died after an ambulance delay in the whole of 2020. In the first nine months of 2022, that  figure had soared to 37, according to the BBC's Newsnight program, which obtained the figures through a Freedom of Information request.
   
      "The reality is, every day, nurses across the UK are walking into understaffed hospitals," Andrea Mackay, who has worked as a nurse for seven years at a hospital in southwest England, told CNN on her reasons for striking last week. 
   
      "During one of my worst shifts I was the only nurse to 28 unwell children," added Jessie Collins, a pediatric nurse. "It's not safe and we cannot deliver the care that these children need at times."
   
      This wave of strikes is the biggest to hit Britain in a decade, and the sheer number of services being affected has drawn comparisons to the so-called winter of discontent of 1978 to 1979.
   
      That period followed bitter pay disputes between the government and both the public and private sector; following her 1979 election victory, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher waged a largely victorious battle with many of Britain's unions, severely diminishing their power.
   
      In reality, the strikes of 2022 have caused a fraction of the impact that those did. 
   
      A total of 417,000 working days were lost to strikes in October, the most recent month for which figures are available, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) â a far cry from the several million days lost at the end of the 1970s. 
   
      But October's figure is the highest number for any month since 2011, and virtually all pay disputes seem far from resolved, stoking fears that next year will be one of mass disruption.
   
      The government of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says it cannot afford the pay demands being made by the public sector unions. In the case of railway strikes, it has said the onus is on private train companies to resolve the disputes â despite the fact that the government controls the purse-strings, having bailed out the network during the Covid-19 pandemic.
   
      But the ongoing disruption is a major headache for Sunak, who took over from Truss with the promise of a sensible and restrained approach to Britain's stuttering economy.
   
      Opinion polls show the government is shouldering much of the blame for the spate of labor unrest, and that the public is generally sympathetic towards striking workers. 
   
      Ministers have repeatedly taken a firm line, refusing to bow to the demands of any one union â opening itself up to criticism that it is not making enough effort bring an end to the strife.
   
      Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer attacked Sunak on the nursing strike in Parliament last week, telling him that "the whole country would breathe a sigh of relief" if he halted the strike by striking a deal with the RCN.
   
      The industrial action was a "a badge of shame for this government," Starmer said.
   
      His party, which has historical links to several unions, is walking a delicate line on the strikes; Starmer has refused to explicitly support unions' demands, but has pointed to their walkouts as evidence that the Conservatives have stalled the economy.
   
      Those arguments will be tested even further over the Christmas period and in the New Year, and public opinion will be vital in strengthening the government's hand or forcing them to the negotiating table.

      Russiaâs militarization of the Arctic shows no sign of slowing down
    
**************************
 
      Russia has continued expanding its military bases in the Arctic region despite significant losses in its war on Ukraine, according to a new series of satellite images obtained by CNN. 
   
      NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also told CNN in an exclusive interview on Friday there is now "a significant Russian military build-up in the high north," with recent tensions causing the alliance to "double its presence" in response.
   
      The findings also come as a senior Western intelligence official told CNN Russia has withdrawn as much as three quarters of its land forces from the High North region near the Arctic, sending them to bolster its faltering invasion of its neighbor, Ukraine.
   
      The satellite pictures, obtained by CNN from Maxar Technologies, show a series of Russian radar bases and runways undergoing improvements over the past year. The images do not show dramatic development, but rather the continued progress of fortifying and expanding an area analysts say is of vital importance to Russia's defensive strategy, at a time of great strain on Moscow's resources.
   
      According to Maxar, the images demonstrate continued work on the radar stations at the Olenegorsk site, on the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia, and at Vorkuta, just north of the Arctic circle. They also appear to show work moving ahead to complete one of five Rezonans-N radar systems at Ostrovnoy, a site located by the Barents Sea, near Norway and Finland in Russia's west. The Rezonans-N are claimed by Russian officials to be able to detect stealth aircraft and objects.

      Three new radomes, the weatherproof enclosures used to protect radar antennas, were completed this year at the Tiksi air defense site, in the far northeast, according to Maxar's images and analysis. There are also improvements to a runway and parking apron at Nagurskoye air base â Russia's northernmost military facility â and runway improvements at âTemp' air base, on Kotelny Island, in the northeast of the country. 
   
      Russia has been bolstering its defenses in the far north for years, refurbishing a series of old Soviet bases with modern designs and equipment.
   
      Its Arctic region has long been key to its oil and gas sector, but also to its nuclear defenses, with a significant proportion of its sophisticated nuclear weaponry and submarine facilities in that area.

      "That deterrence has always been ready," said a senior Western intelligence official. "It's never down to low readiness; it's a high status all the time," the official said.
   
      At the start of the war with Ukraine in February some submarines were repositioned to signal "this is a real capability," the official added, but they soon returned to standard high readiness.
   
      NATO chief Stoltenberg reasoned: "The shortest way from Russia to North America is over the Arctic North Pole. So the strategic importance of these areas has not changed because of the war in Ukraine."
   
      "We see Russia reopening old Soviet bases, military sites," he said, noting that it is also "testing novel weapons in the Arctic and the high north."
   Satellite image Â©2022 Maxar Technologies 
      The war in Ukraine has led to a major adjustment in Russia's troop strengths in the region, the senior Western intelligence official said. "They're down to somewhere between 20 and 25% of their original land forces up there. But then the naval component is totally untouched by the war," they noted.
   
      Following strikes earlier this month on two key airfields deep inside Russia in Ryazan and Saratov, Russian military jets and bombers have been dispersed across the country and the Arctic north, the official added. Moscow has blamed the strikes on Ukraine, while Kyiv has offered no comment on the explosions at the Russian bases. 
   
      The Arctic is also vital to Russia because its melting ice is rapidly opening up new shipping routes from Asia's southeast to Europe, using a much shorter path along the Russian coast. 
   
      The Northern Sea Route could cut around two weeks off the current journey time across the Suez Canal. Russian state TV has reveled in the launch of several atomic-powered icebreakers, designed to boost Russian influence and power in the region. Critics say Moscow is seeking to exert outsized control over a route that should be equally accessible to all nations.
   
      Speaking via videolink at the launch of a new nuclear-powered icebreaker in St. Petersburg last month (November 22), Russian President Vladimir Putin said the development of the "most important" Northern Sea Route "will allow Russia to fully reveal its export potential and to establish effective logistics routes, including to southeast Asia."
   
      At the same time, the war in Ukraine has boosted NATO's presence in the region. Once Finland and Sweden join the block, as is widely expected, seven out of eight Arctic states will be NATO members. 
   
      The alliance has also ramped up its military clout in the region. In August, Norway released the first images of US B52 bombers flying over its territory escorted by Norwegian F35 jets and 2 Swedish JAS Gripen. 
   
      Increased signaling by NATO included a recent test of the new weapons system, the Rapid Dragon Palletized Munition Deployment, involving a complex drop by US special forces of a normal supply pallet from the back of a C130 cargo craft. 
   
      
      On Snake Island, the rocky Black Sea outcrop that became a Ukraine war legend
     
      The pallet contains a cruise missile, which launches as the pallet falls by parachute. The display was designed to show the United States can launch these powerful weapons systems from the back of an ordinary cargo plane. The test took place in Norway, not far from the Russian border.
   
      NATO has also become increasingly concerned about the potential sabotage of Norway's oil and gas infrastructure. Now Russian energy is subject to sanctions, Norway's natural gas makes up more than 20% of Europe's supply, according to some analysis. 
   
      "Since the sabotage in the Baltic Sea," Stoltenberg said, "we have doubled our presence, with ships, with submarines, with maritime patrol aircrafts in the Baltic and North Seas, partly to monitor, to have better situational awareness, but also to send a message of deterrence and readiness to protect this critical infrastructure." The NATO head was referring to the blasts at the Nord Stream pipeline in September, which were caused by an act of sabotage, according to Swedish prosecutors, after evidence of explosives was discovered at the sites.
   
      The senior intelligence official said, however, that a recent Norwegian review of its infrastructure security concluded no major attempts to attack it had occurred and that "the oil infrastructure is well secured now."

      2 people are dead, 12 injured after 6.4 magnitude earthquake strikes Northern California
    
**************************
 
      A 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck Northern California's Eureka area early Tuesday, the US Geological Survey said, leaving at least two people dead, drawing reports of damage to roads and homes, shaking residents from their sleep and leaving tens of thousands without electricity.
   
      The epicenter of the quake, which struck at 2:34 a.m. PT, was in the Pacific about 15 miles from Fortuna, a city of about 12,000 people in Humboldt County, part of California's forested Redwood Coast. Fortuna is near Eureka and about a 280-mile drive northwest of Sacramento.
   
      At least two people are dead "as a result of medical emergencies" during and after the earthquake, according to the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office. Twelve injuries were reported.
   
      While there are few specifics on the injuries at this time, none are considered critical, said Humboldt County Sheriff William F. Honsal. Injury numbers are expected to go up, he added.
   
      The two people who died, aÂ 72-year-old and an 83-year-old, had medical emergencies sometime during the earthquake and emergency services couldn't reach them in a timely manner, HonsalÂ said.
   
      Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency, which allows Humboldt County to access resources under the California Disaster Assistance Act, Newsom's office said in a release.
   
      "Jennifer and I send our heartfelt condolences to the families grieving the loss of loved ones and offer our best wishes for the recovery of those who were injured in this earthquake," Newsom said in a statement.
   
      More than three dozen smaller quakes â as powerful as a 4.6 magnitude â struck the area afterward, the survey reported. Tuesday's temblor comes a year after a 6.2 magnitude quake struck just off Humboldt County's Cape Mendocino on December 20, 2021, and caused minor damage to buildings in the area.
   
      LIVE UPDATES: Earthquake shakes Northern California
   
      Most homes and businesses in Humboldt County were without power early Tuesday. Nearly 70,000 outages were reported as of about 1 p.m. PT â out of 99,000 customers tracked in the county â according to utility tracker PowerOutage.us.
   
      In Rio Dell, one of the cities impacted by the earthquake, city manager Kyle KnoppÂ said water and power remain out, and the county is under a boil notice.
   
      "Widespread damages to roads and homes" were being reported throughout Humboldt County, the county sheriff's office said Tuesday morning on Twitter. At least two people were injured, the sheriff's office said.
   
      Wendy Pickett Monolias awoke to the shaking in Eureka.
   
      "Once the shaking finally stopped, we got our flashlights and phones and looked around. Everything was in shambles," Pickett Monolias said. "Things you wouldn't expect to have fallen over or broken did. An entire cabinet in the bathroom fell over and broke apart."
   
      The quake spilled a number of items to the floor of Caroline Titus' Ferndale-area home, a video she posted to Twitter shows. "This was a big one. Power is out now. House is a big mess," Titus wrote.
   
      Northeast of Ferndale, the temblor damaged part of the Fernbridge, which carries State Route 211 over the Eel River, CNN affiliate KRCR reported.
   
      How earthquakes are measured
   
      Part of the road at the bridge was cracked, an image tweeted by the California Department of Transportation showed.
   
      "The bridge is closed while we conduct safety inspections due to possible seismic damage," the tweet reads.
   
      In downtown Fortuna, some storefront windows were shattered, and people were putting up boards to fill the gaps on a rainy Tuesday morning, video from KRCR shows.
   
      The main quake produced at least some shaking from coastal Oregon to south of San Jose, California, public reports collected by the survey show.
   
      It poses no tsunami threat, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.

Russia's war in Ukraine
**************************
 Live Russia's war in Ukraine Live House Jan. 6 committee report  By Adrienne Vogt, Leinz Vales, Aditi Sangal, Rhea Mogul, Hannah Strange and Sophie Tanno, CNN  From CNN's Allison Malloy US President Joe Biden just tweeted ahead of his surprise visit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this afternoon, expressing good wishes to Zelensky and writing that the two leaders have "much to discuss."  From CNN's Kevin Liptak   US President Joe Biden invited his Ukrainian counterpart to Washington this week because he determined the war in Ukraine had entered a new stage, a top US official said Wednesday. "The President really believes that as we approach winter, as we enter ... a new phase in this war, Mr. Putin's aggression, that this is a good time for the two leaders to sit down face to face and talk," said John Kirby, the strategic communications coordinator at the National Security Council, on "CNN This Morning." The talks are expected to center on continued US military and economic assistance, along with sustaining sanctions on Russia and supporting the Ukrainian people. But Kirby said the two would also discuss how the war might end — a sensitive topic that's been the subject of some disagreements among Western leaders. He said Zelensky was cognizant of the risks he was taking in leaving Ukraine, and the US was working to ensure the trip is safe. "We are working in lockstep with him and his staff to make sure we can make this trip safely, both coming through the United States, and coming back. We will continue to support his travel requirements as best we can," he said. He declined to say when the sophisticated Patriot missile defense system that Biden is expected to announce Wednesday would be operational inside Ukraine. "It takes a long time for our troops to get trained on how to operate them. So, we will have to factor all of that in," he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to address Congress at 7:30 p.m. ET. Prior to his address, Zelensky will meet with President Joe Biden and the two will convene a White House news conference. Biden is expected to announce he is sending nearly $2 billion in additional security assistance to Ukraine, including a sophisticated new air defense system.  From CNN's Kevin Liptak and MJ Lee An American military aircraft was involved in bringing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to Washington for his meetings Wednesday, according to US officials. The US was heavily involved in the security arrangements to bring Zelensky from and back to Ukraine for the first time since the Russian invasion began. After Zelensky accepted Biden's invitation to visit a week ago, the two sides immediately began making the security arrangements for the visit. Zelensky plans to leave Washington immediately after his address to Congress on Capitol Hill, making his visit only a matter of a few hours. Zelensky traveled to Poland by train as part of his journey to the United States on Wednesday. Video by CNN affiliate TVN in Poland captured the moment Zelensky arrived by train in Przemysl, near the Polish-Ukrainian border. The shot date is Dec. 21, but does not give an indication of time. Zelensky is then seen in a white 4x4 vehicle waiting to depart in a convoy. According to TVN, Zelensky then flew to from Rzeszow airport on his way to Washington. Zelensky was seen with US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Ann Brink. From CNN’s Anna Chernova and Sugam Pokharel     Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Wednesday that "partial mobilization" has been a "serious trial" for Russia and its army.  "It has become a criterion for the maturity of Russian society and a serious trial for the country and the armed forces,” he told a meeting of the Russian Defense Ministry board in Moscow.  Some background: Moscow announced in October that its “partial mobilization” of hundreds of thousands of citizens to fight in the country’s war on Ukraine had been completed. The announcement in late September sparked protests and an exodus of men from the country.  From CNN’s Clare Sebastian, Anna Chernova and Sugam Pokharel Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that Russia needs to “continue to support and improve readiness” of its nuclear weapons.   “We need to continue to support, and to improve the readiness of our nuclear units. This is the main guarantee of our sovereignty and territorial integrity.  A strategic priority is the overall balance of power in the world,” he told a meeting of the Russian Defense Ministry board in Moscow.  Putin also accused key NATO countries of using their military potential against Russia.  Putin claimed that Moscow’s “strategic adversaries” have been planning to “disintegrate, weaken and divide” Russia. “Our strategic adversaries have the goal of disintegrating and weakening, dividing our country. This has been going on for centuries. [Russia is] too big, as they think, a country that poses a threat to someone. Therefore, it needs to be broken down, cut down a little,” he said.  His speech started right after those in attendance observed a moment of silence for those who "gave their lives for the motherland.”  From CNN's Seb Shukla and Sugam Pokharel   President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to Poland by train as part of his journey to the United States on Wednesday.  Video by CNN affiliate TVN in Poland captured the moment Zelensky arrived by train in Przemysl, near the Polish/Ukrainian border. The shot date is Dec. 21, but does not give an indication of time. Zelensky is then seen in a white 4x4 vehicle waiting to depart in a convoy.  According to TVN, Zelensky then flew to the US from Rzeszow (RZE) airport to Washington. Zelensky was seen with US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Ann Brink. Zelensky is set to pay a dramatic surprise visit to Washington on Wednesday, using his first trip outside his homeland since it was invaded 300 days ago to rally his top international partner behind sustained military and economic assistance.  From CNN's Jessie Gretener   The UN nuclear watchdog IAEA has confirmed that its chief Rafael Grossi will be traveling to Moscow on Thursday to discuss nuclear safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. "We can confirm that Director General Grossi will be in Moscow tomorrow as part of his ongoing high-level consultations aimed at agreeing and implementing a nuclear safety and security zone around the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) as soon as possible," the IAEA said in a statement on Wednesday.  The plant, in Russian-occupied territory, has come under repeated shelling attacks prompting concerns about a nuclear disaster. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for the attacks.  There are no plans for Grossi to meet Russia’s President Vladimir Putin during the visit, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.   Missile strikes in the Zaporizhzhia region have increased in recent weeks. Earlier in the week, the head of the Zaporizhzhia Region Military Administration, Oleksandr Starukh, told a briefing that the energy situation is currently difficult. All six units at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are out of operation. Starukh said that "they are in partially cold and partially hot shutdown mode."  From CNN’s Max Foster and Robert Iddiols Iconic sites around the world will turn off their lights on Wednesday in solidarity with Ukraine.  London’s famous Wembley Stadium arch, the Colosseum in Rome, Sydney Opera House, and Toronto’s CN Tower are going to turn the lights out tonight at 8pm (local time) as part of the #LightUpUkraine campaign, according to organizers.  Many Ukrainians face a winter of blackouts as the country rebuffs attacks on its civilian infrastructure by invading Russian forces.  The landmark locations join a host of other sites across Europe in pledging their support.  The campaign aims to raise $10 million via the UNITED24, Ukraine’s national fundraising platform, for 1000 generators to power hospitals this winter. According to the organizers, Ukrainian doctors have to save lives and perform complex surgeries by flashlight, posing an additional threat to people’s lives.

      Why Zelenskyâs surprise US visit is so hugely significant
    
**************************
 
      President Volodymyr Zelensky's White House visit Wednesday will symbolically bolster America's role as the arsenal of democracy in the bitter war for Ukraine's survival and send a stunning public rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
   
      That his first trip outside Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February is to the United States will also highlight President Joe Biden's historic role in reviving the Western alliance that kept the Soviet Union at bay and is now countering new expansionism by Moscow in an effective proxy war between nuclear superpowers.
   
      Zelensky's arrival will draw poignant echoes of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's arrival in Washington, 81 years ago on Thursday, days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. That Christmas visit cemented the alliance that would win World War II and built the post-war democratic world. 
   
      
      Zelensky to make dramatic surprise visit to Washington to rally US support for Ukraine's defense
     
      Zelensky compared his nation's resistance against Russia with Britain's lonely defiance of the Nazis in the days before the US entered World War II during a video address to the UK Parliament earlier this year, and his arrival in the US capital will sharpen the parallels to the earlier meeting of Churchill and President Franklin Roosevelt.
   
      His visit is unfolding amid extraordinary security. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wouldn't even confirm the early reports that she'd welcome Zelensky to the US Capitol in an unexpected coda to her speakership, saying on Tuesday evening, "We don't know yet. We just don't know."
   
      A White House reception for Zelensky, who sources said was traveling to the US on Tuesday night, will above all be an unmistakable sign of US and Western support for Ukraine's battle against Putin, who says the country has no right to exist. The war exemplifies what Biden has framed as a global struggle between democracy and totalitarianism, which he has put at the center of his foreign policy.
   
      Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who visited Ukraine earlier this month, said on CNN's "AC360" that Zelensky was coming to Washington on a specific mission. "What he is trying to do is draw a direct correlation between our support and the survival and support and future victory of Ukraine," Gallego, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said.
   
      Biden will announce an additional $1.8 billion in security assistance to Ukraine during the visit, with the coveted Patriot missile systems as part of that package, a US official told CNN's Phil Mattingly. Washington also plans to send Ukraine precision bomb kits to convert less sophisticated munitions into "smart bombs" that could help it target Russian defensive lines, sources told CNN's Pentagon team. Zelensky's visit also comes as Congress is poised to sign off on another $45 billion in aid for Ukraine and NATO allies, deepening the commitment that has helped Kyiv's forces inflict an unexpectedly bloody price on Putin's forces. 
   
      The decision on Patriots, which would satisfy a long-standing Ukrainian request, reflects a US process of matching its aid to the shifting strategy of Russia's assault. The system would help Kyiv better counter Russia's brutal missile attacks on cities and electricity installations, which it has mounted in an effective attempt to weaponize bitter winter weather to break the will of Ukrainian civilians.
   
      The meeting between Biden and Zelensky, who have spoken multiple times by phone and video link-ups but have not met in person since the invasion, comes at a vital moment in the war. Biden has for months cautiously calibrated US shipments of arms and weapons systems in a way designed to save Ukraine but to avoid escalating the conflict into a disastrous direct clash between NATO and Russia. He, for instance, rejected Ukrainian calls for the West to enforce a no-fly zone over the country. The Patriots â a long range-aerial defense system â would represent the deepest US dive into the conflict so far. 
   
      Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, Wesley Clark said that Zelensky's trip reflects a critical moment when the destiny of a war that Ukraine cannot win without upgraded US support could be decided before Russia can regroup.
   
      "This is a window of opportunity for Ukraine and a window of danger as well," Clark told CNN's John Berman on "AC360" on Tuesday.
   
      "Russia's weak, (but) Russia will be stronger. This is a period where the United States needs to pour in the support. â¦ This is the window, President Zelensky knows it â if he is going to defeat, with US support, the Russian aggression in Ukraine," Clark said.
   
      "Wait until the summer and it will be an entirely different battlefield."
   
      But the highly public nature of Zelensky's visit, and the expected announcement regarding Patriots, also risks further provoking Putin when he is signaling that, as disastrous as the war has been for Russia's troops, he's in for the long haul, betting the West's commitment will eventually ebb.
   
      His visit to Congress will also play into an increasingly important debate on Capitol Hill over Ukraine aid with Republicans set to take over the House majority in the new year. Some pro-Donald Trump members, who will have significant leverage in the thin GOP majority, have warned that billions of dollars in US cash that have been sent to Ukraine should instead be shoring up the US southern border with a surge of new migrants expected within days.
   
      Conscious of pressure from his right flank, the possible next speaker, GOP Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, has warned that Ukraine should not expect a "blank check" from the new House. Even though Ukraine still has strong Republican support in the Senate, it's this kind of shifting political dynamic that appears to inform Kremlin perceptions about how long US resolve will last in a conflict on which Putin's political survival may well depend.
   
      Zelensky's pre-Christmas trip promises to be the greatest public relations coup yet for the media savvy comic actor-turned-president, who has cleverly tapped into the history and patriotic mythology of Western nations in a series of video addresses to lawmakers from war-torn Kyiv. Often, while grateful for outside support, he has seemed to be trying to shame the West to do more and to create a deeper understanding among voters for the trials facing Ukraine. 
   
      In March, for instance, Zelensky evoked Mount Rushmore and Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I have a Dream Speech" during a virtual address to Congress. He also referred to two days of infamy in modern history when Americans directly experienced the fear of aerial bombardment.
   
      "Remember Pearl Harbor, terrible morning of December 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you. Just remember it," Zelensky said. "Remember September 11, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn your cities, independent territories, into battlefields. When innocent people were attacked, attacked from air, just like nobody else expected it, you could not stop it. Our country experiences the same every day."
   
      When Zelensky arrives in Washington, he might well experience the same revelation that Churchill did over the capital's blazing lights at Christmas after months in the dark of air raid blackouts back home. 
   
      The wartime British leader sailed to the United States aboard HMS Duke of York, dodging U-boats in the wintery Atlantic and took a plane from the coast of Virginia to Washington, where he was met on December 22, 1941, by President Franklin Roosevelt before their joint press conference the next day.
   
      Over days of brainstorming and meetings â fueled by Churchill's regime of sherry with breakfast, Scotch and sodas for lunch, champagne in the evening and a tipple of 90-year-old brandy before bed â the two leaders plotted the defeat of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan and laid the foundation of the Western alliance that Biden has reinvigorated in his support for Ukraine. 
   
      Churchill, who had pined for US involvement in World War II for months and knew it was the key to defeating Adolf Hitler, said during his visit, "I spend this anniversary and festival far from my country, far from my family, and yet I cannot truthfully say that I feel far from home."
   
      Zelensky is sure to get that kind of hero's welcome and will hope that extra US support will mean that Washington has truly "drawn the sword for freedom and cast away the scabbard," as Churchill said of the Roosevelt administration in his address to Congress on December 26, 1941.
   
      The Ukrainian leader is likely to appreciate the historical parallels. He paraphrased one of Churchill's most famous wartime speeches in an emotional address to British members of parliament in March.
   
      "We will not surrender, we will not lose, we will go to the end," he said.

      Zelenskyâs Washington trip marks a victory in the PR war with Putin
    
**************************
 
      On the last week before the Gregorian Christmas, the optics of Russia's war in Ukraine have taken on a different dynamic and demonstrates that the battle is not only being fought on the frigid frontlines in Ukraine, but is also becoming something of a PR tit-for-tat.
   
      Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has harnessed the media to become an ever-present figure on screens across the world, beaming himself into parliaments, conferences and even music festivals. 
   
      Russian President Vladimir Putin, a past master of propaganda, is driving his own agenda through his absolute control of Russian state media. Comparisons between the two show a chasm that may reflect the larger narrative of the war. 
   
      Last Friday, according to the Kremlin, Putin "spent all day working at the joint staff of military branches involved in the special military operation."
   
      But the only images that emerged were of Putin at the head of a table of generals, dressed in a navy suit and tie, listening to military chiefs who kowtow to his every whim. There was no mention of a location for this meeting, no readout, nor did the President make any public comments. 
   
      Zelensky, by contrast, broadcast his location to the world. 
   
      He spent Tuesday morning on the frozen frontlines, visiting troops in the beleaguered town of Bakhmut. The location was significant: Zelensky and his generals have repeatedly said this part of the 1,300km-long frontline in Ukraine sees the most persistent and deadly fighting. Dressed in khaki fatigues, he called his soldiers "superhuman."
   
      Zelensky is no stranger to the frontlines in the east of his country. Last week he posted a selfie-video from the town of Slovyansk.  Perhaps that visit prompted the Kremlin into action. 
   
      On Sunday the Russian Defense Ministry released a video purporting to show Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu inspecting the troops involved in the so-called "special military operation" in Ukraine.
   
      But the video was not labeled as being from any particular region. Nor did it reveal any identifying locations. In fact, the only thing it revealed at all was Shoigu in a helicopter, and that Russia still has some functioning helicopters.
   
      The starkest of contrasts came this week.
   
      On Tuesday in Moscow, Vladimir Putin handed out medals in the gilded halls of the Kremlin â again, clad in a dark suit and maroon tie. The honors, including a red sash, were bestowed on the Russian-installed leaders of the occupied regions of Ukraine: Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.
   
      The hand-wringing and bouquet-brandishing could not have been more at odds with how President Zelensky wrapped up his visit to Bakhmut. Standing in a secret underground location, he handed out medals to soldiers, weapons slung across their shoulders, risking their lives in defense.
   
      From Bakhmut, Zelensky delivered rousing words: "The East is holding out because Bakhmut is fighting. This is the fortress of our morale. In fierce battles and at the cost of many lives, freedom is being defended here for all of us. Bakhmut defenders deserve our maximum support and our highest gratitude."
   
      But the coup de grÃ¢ce was delivered by Zelensky's office in a press statement on Tuesday evening. "The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy started an official visit to the United States of America," it read.
   
      There is little coincidence that Zelensky has decided to make the US his first official visit outside of Ukraine since the 300 day-old war.
   
      On Monday, President Putin made a rare trip to Minsk, Belarus, to visit his ally, President Alexander Lukashenko, often ascribed the moniker of Europe's last dictator. The two men, viewed as pariahs by large swaths of the Western world, were seen hugging on a red carpet on a frozen morning at an airport in Minsk.
   
      In contrast, Zelensky will shake hands with â and maybe even hug â the leader of the world's most powerful nation, the free world, speak to reporters on the South Lawn, sign a momentous defense package which includes the vital Patriot air-defense systems, which the Kremlin has described as being a "red line", and give an address to Congress. 
   
      It is the ultimate flex from Zelensky to Putin and not an insignificant achievement for his first trip outside the country since the war began.

      Exclusive: Biden task force investigating how US tech ends up in Iranian attack drones used against Ukraine
    
**************************
 
      Theâ¯Biden administration has launched an expansive task force to investigate how US and western components,â¯including American-made microelectronics, are ending up in Iranian-made drones Russia is launching by the hundreds into Ukraine, multiple officials familiar with the effort tell CNN.â¯ 
   
      The US has imposed tough export control restrictions and sanctions to prevent Iran from obtaining high-end materials, but evidence has emerged that suggests Iran is finding an abundance of commercially-available technology.â¯ 
   
      Last month, the UK-based investigative organizationâ¯ Conflict Armament Research examinedâ¯ severalâ¯drones that had been downed in Ukraineâ¯and found that 82% of their components were manufactured by companies based in the US.â¯ 
   
      Among the components found in some of the drones areâ¯processors built by the Dallas-based technology company Texas Instruments, according to an investigation by the Ukrainian Armed Forces and a source familiar with the US inquiry, as well as an engine made by an Austrian firm owned by Canada's Bombardier Recreational Products. Both companies have condemned any use of their technology for illicit purposes.â¯ 
   
      Their apparently unintentional ensnarement in Iran's drone manufacturing industry underscoresâ¯how inexpensive products intended for civilian use can be easily retrofitted for military purposes, and often fall just outside the bounds of sanctions and export control regimes.â¯â¯ 
   
      Texas Instruments said in a statement to CNN that "TI is not selling any products into Russia, Belarus or Iran. TI complies with applicable laws and regulations in the countries where we operate, and partners with law enforcement organizations as necessary and appropriate. Additionally, we do not support or condone the use of our products in applications they weren't designed for. " 
   
      Bombardier Recreational Products â¯said in a statement that it was launching an investigationâ¯into how the engines ended up in the drones. 
   
      Theâ¯investigationâ¯has intensified in recent weeks amidâ¯intelligence obtained by the USâ¯that the Kremlin is preparing to open its own factory for drone production insideâ¯Russia as part of a deal with Iran, the officials said.â¯ 
   
      Iran has already begun transferring blueprints and components for the drones to Russia to help with production there,â¯CNN has reported,â¯in a dramatic expansion of the countries' military partnership.â¯ 
   
      Agencies across Washington are involved in the task force, including the departments of Defense, State, Justice, Commerce and Treasury, with one official describing the inquiry as an "all hands on deck" initiative. The effort is being overseen by the White House National Security Council as part of an even bigger, "holistic approach" to dealing with Iran, a senior administration official said, from its crackdown on protesters and its nuclear program to its deepening role in the war in Ukraine. 
   
      But the drone issue is particularly urgent given the sheer volume of US-made components, many of them manufactured in the last couple years, that have been found in the Iranian dronesâ¯Russia has been deploying across Ukraineâ¯against civilians and critical infrastructure.â¯ 
   
      Conflict Armament Research found that the Iranian drones they examined in Ukraine in Novemberâ¯had "higher-end technological capabilities," including tactical-grade sensors and semiconductors sourced outside of Iran, demonstrating that Tehran "has been able to circumvent current sanction regimes and has added more capabilities and resiliency to its weapons." 
   
      National Security Council officialâ¯John Kirbyâ¯told reporters earlier this month thatâ¯the US would be sanctioning three Russian companies involved in acquiring and using the Iranian drones, andâ¯is "assessing further steps we can take in terms of export controls to restrict Iran's access to sensitive technologies."â¯ 
   
      Much of that work has fallen to the task force, officials said, and among its first tasks has been toâ¯notifyâ¯all of the American companies whose components have been found in the drones.â¯Congressional staffers briefed on the effort told CNN that they hope the task force provides lawmakers with a list of US companies whose equipment is being found in the drones in an effort to force greater accountability by urging the companies to monitor their supply chains more closely. 
   
      The task force is also having to coordinate with foreign allies, since the components being used in the drones are not limited to those produced by American companies.â¯ Conflict Armament Research also found that "more than 70 manufacturers based in 13 different countries and territories" produced the components in the Iranian drones they examined.  
   
      In October,â¯CNN obtained accessâ¯to a droneâ¯that was downed in the Black Sea near Odesa and captured by Ukrainian forces. It was found to contain Japanese batteries, an Austrian engine and American processors.â¯ 
   
      Iran may also be acquiring near-exact replicas of western components from China, according to a study published last month by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security. "China plays a larger role than previously assessed in enabling Iran to manufacture and supply drones to Russian forces," the report found. "It appears that Chinese companies are supplying Iran with copies of Western commodities to produce UAV combat drones." 
   
      The White House believes it is successfully driving home the scale of the issue with allies.â¯The senior administration official told CNN that there was "growing broad and deep international consensus on Iran, from the EU to Canada to Australia and New Zealand, which is being led by US diplomacy." 
   
      There is no evidence that any of the western companies are knowingly exporting their technology to be used in the drones, and that is partly why the task force's job has been so difficult, officials said.â¯ 
   
      The task force has its work cut out for it in tracing supply chains for the microelectronics industry, whichâ¯relies heavily on third party distributors and resellers. The microchips and other small devices ending up in so many of the Iranian and Russian drones are not only inexpensive and widely available, they are also easily hidden.â¯ 
   
      Iran also uses front companies toâ¯buy equipment from the US and EUâ¯that may have a dual use, like theâ¯Austrianâ¯engines, that Tehran can then use to build drones, according to theâ¯Treasury Department, which sanctioned several of those companies in September.â¯ 
   
      â¯That makes supply chain monitoring a challenge, though experts say US and European companies could be doing a lot more to track where their products are going.â¯ 
   
      "American companies should be doing a lot more to track their supply chains," said Dmitri Alperovitch, the former chief technology officer at the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.â¯ 
   
      Keeping better track of resellers is a first step, he said, but the task is admittedly difficult because so many of these companies' products are so commoditized and available off-the-shelf and online for civil purposes. Ultimately, neutering some Iranian front companies with sanctions and cutting off their supply from some western companies will be akin to "a game of whack a mole," Alperovitch said, noting that they "can easily find another supplier."  
   
      He added that the real "weak underbelly" of US policy when it comes to export controls is enforcementâand prosecuting the specific individuals involved in the illicit transactions.â¯ 
   
      "You can put companies on the [sanctioned] entities list," he added, "but if you don't actually go after the people involved, itâ¯doesn't mean a whole lot."â¯

      Russiaâs militarization of the Arctic shows no sign of slowing down
    
**************************
 
      Russia has continued expanding its military bases in the Arctic region despite significant losses in its war on Ukraine, according to a new series of satellite images obtained by CNN. 
   
      NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also told CNN in an exclusive interview on Friday there is now "a significant Russian military build-up in the high north," with recent tensions causing the alliance to "double its presence" in response.
   
      The findings also come as a senior Western intelligence official told CNN Russia has withdrawn as much as three quarters of its land forces from the High North region near the Arctic, sending them to bolster its faltering invasion of its neighbor, Ukraine.
   
      The satellite pictures, obtained by CNN from Maxar Technologies, show a series of Russian radar bases and runways undergoing improvements over the past year. The images do not show dramatic development, but rather the continued progress of fortifying and expanding an area analysts say is of vital importance to Russia's defensive strategy, at a time of great strain on Moscow's resources.
   
      According to Maxar, the images demonstrate continued work on the radar stations at the Olenegorsk site, on the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia, and at Vorkuta, just north of the Arctic circle. They also appear to show work moving ahead to complete one of five Rezonans-N radar systems at Ostrovnoy, a site located by the Barents Sea, near Norway and Finland in Russia's west. The Rezonans-N are claimed by Russian officials to be able to detect stealth aircraft and objects.

      Three new radomes, the weatherproof enclosures used to protect radar antennas, were completed this year at the Tiksi air defense site, in the far northeast, according to Maxar's images and analysis. There are also improvements to a runway and parking apron at Nagurskoye air base â Russia's northernmost military facility â and runway improvements at âTemp' air base, on Kotelny Island, in the northeast of the country. 
   
      Russia has been bolstering its defenses in the far north for years, refurbishing a series of old Soviet bases with modern designs and equipment.
   
      Its Arctic region has long been key to its oil and gas sector, but also to its nuclear defenses, with a significant proportion of its sophisticated nuclear weaponry and submarine facilities in that area.
   Satellite image Â©2022 Maxar Technologies 
      "That deterrence has always been ready," said a senior Western intelligence official. "It's never down to low readiness; it's a high status all the time," the official said.
   
      At the start of the war with Ukraine in February some submarines were repositioned to signal "this is a real capability," the official added, but they soon returned to standard high readiness.
   
      NATO chief Stoltenberg reasoned: "The shortest way from Russia to North America is over the Arctic North Pole. So the strategic importance of these areas has not changed because of the war in Ukraine."
   
      "We see Russia reopening old Soviet bases, military sites," he said, noting that it is also "testing novel weapons in the Arctic and the high north."
   Satellite image Â©2022 Maxar Technologies 
      The war in Ukraine has led to a major adjustment in Russia's troop strengths in the region, the senior Western intelligence official said. "They're down to somewhere between 20 and 25% of their original land forces up there. But then the naval component is totally untouched by the war," they noted.
   
      Following strikes earlier this month on two key airfields deep inside Russia in Ryazan and Saratov, Russian military jets and bombers have been dispersed across the country and the Arctic north, the official added. Moscow has blamed the strikes on Ukraine, while Kyiv has offered no comment on the explosions at the Russian bases. 
   
      The Arctic is also vital to Russia because its melting ice is rapidly opening up new shipping routes from Asia's southeast to Europe, using a much shorter path along the Russian coast. 
   
      The Northern Sea Route could cut around two weeks off the current journey time across the Suez Canal. Russian state TV has reveled in the launch of several atomic-powered icebreakers, designed to boost Russian influence and power in the region. Critics say Moscow is seeking to exert outsized control over a route that should be equally accessible to all nations.
   
      Speaking via videolink at the launch of a new nuclear-powered icebreaker in St. Petersburg last month (November 22), Russian President Vladimir Putin said the development of the "most important" Northern Sea Route "will allow Russia to fully reveal its export potential and to establish effective logistics routes, including to southeast Asia."
   
      At the same time, the war in Ukraine has boosted NATO's presence in the region. Once Finland and Sweden join the block, as is widely expected, seven out of eight Arctic states will be NATO members. 
   
      The alliance has also ramped up its military clout in the region. In August, Norway released the first images of US B52 bombers flying over its territory escorted by Norwegian F35 jets and 2 Swedish JAS Gripen. 
   
      Increased signaling by NATO included a recent test of the new weapons system, the Rapid Dragon Palletized Munition Deployment, involving a complex drop by US special forces of a normal supply pallet from the back of a C130 cargo craft. 
   
      
      On Snake Island, the rocky Black Sea outcrop that became a Ukraine war legend
     
      The pallet contains a cruise missile, which launches as the pallet falls by parachute. The display was designed to show the United States can launch these powerful weapons systems from the back of an ordinary cargo plane. The test took place in Norway, not far from the Russian border.
   
      NATO has also become increasingly concerned about the potential sabotage of Norway's oil and gas infrastructure. Now Russian energy is subject to sanctions, Norway's natural gas makes up more than 20% of Europe's supply, according to some analysis. 
   
      "Since the sabotage in the Baltic Sea," Stoltenberg said, "we have doubled our presence, with ships, with submarines, with maritime patrol aircrafts in the Baltic and North Seas, partly to monitor, to have better situational awareness, but also to send a message of deterrence and readiness to protect this critical infrastructure." The NATO head was referring to the blasts at the Nord Stream pipeline in September, which were caused by an act of sabotage, according to Swedish prosecutors, after evidence of explosives was discovered at the sites.
   
      The senior intelligence official said, however, that a recent Norwegian review of its infrastructure security concluded no major attempts to attack it had occurred and that "the oil infrastructure is well secured now."

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/20/politics/house-trump-tax-returns/index.html

      Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee set to release Trumpâs taxes in the coming days
    
**************************
 
      The Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee said Tuesday it would release former President Donald Trump's tax returns within days and asserted that the IRS failed to properly audit the former president's taxes while he was in office.
   
      The committee also released a report Tuesday that detailed six years' worth of the former president's tax returns, including his claims of massive annual losses that significantly reduced his tax burden.
   
      Chairman Richard Neal and fellow Democrats said Tuesday that the records they obtained showed that the presidential audit program failed to work as intended. The Massachusetts Democrat charged that the required audit of Trump's taxes "did not occur," as his returns were only subjected to the mandatory audit once, in 2019, after Democrats inquired. 
   
      "The research that was done as it relates to the mandatory audit program was nonexistent," Neal told reporters after the committee hearing. 
   
      The committee also released a supplemental report from the Joint Committee on Taxation that included details on Trump's tax returns from 2015 to 2020, ahead of the planned release of the returns themselves.
   
      
      READ: The House Ways and Means Committee's summary report on Donald Trump's taxes
     
      Those underlying documents, however, will need to undergo significant redactions first. 
   
      The release of Trump's tax returns marks the conclusion of a nearly four-year legal battle House Democrats waged against the former president after they took control of the House in 2019. 
   
      The audit program was important to Democrats because it was the justification they used to obtain the returns in the first place â but the Democratic pursuit was also tied in part to long-held suspicions about Trump's taxes after he would not release his returns while running for president in 2016 or once in office.
   
      The committee also made legislative recommendations to bolster the presidential audit program, including new requirements "for the mandatory examination of the President with disclosure of certain audit information and related returns in a timely manner." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday evening that the House would "move swiftly" to advance the legislation, even though Congress is days away from adjourning.
   
      In a separate report, the Joint Committee on Taxation offered a summary of its review of tax returns between 2015 and 2020 for Trump and several of his businesses. The JCT noted in its report it had no investigatory power â it couldn't demand documents from Trump or his businesses or interview IRS agents assigned to Trump's audits â so the committee issued no opinion about whether Trump should have paid more or less taxes. 
   
      Trump reported a stunning reversal of fortune during the middle two years of his presidency that led to a considerable tax bill, according to the report from the Joint Committee on Taxation. The $1.1 million paid in federal taxes in 2018 and 2019 stand in stark contrast to the $750 he paid in 2017 and $0 in 2020.
   
      Trump's tax bill grew substantially as his income surged in 2018 and 2019. Trump reported a $22 million capital gain in 2018 and a $9 million gain in 2019 from asset sales, sending his income into the black following years of enormous losses.
   
      In 2015 and 2016, Trump reported he lost more than $32 million each year. In 2017, Trump said he lost nearly $13 million. But he reported taxable income of $24 million in 2018 and more than $4 million in 2019, giving him a sizeable tax bill.
   
      However, in 2020, as the pandemic hit, Trump once again reported a gigantic loss of nearly $5 million. He paid $0 in federal income taxes that year.
   
      Evident in tax information broken out in the Joint Committee on Taxation report on Trump's tax returns from 2015-2020 is Trump's pattern â as previously shown by a New York Times investigation â of generating huge net operating losses and then carrying them forward for years afterward to zero out his tax liabilities. For instance, the JCT noted that Trump carried forward $105 million in losses on his 2015 return, $73 million in 2016, $45 million in 2017 and $23 million in 2018.
   
      
      Supreme Court allows House committee to get Trump's tax returns
     
      A spokesperson for Trump accused House Democrats of playing politics for moving to release his tax returns to the public.
   
      "This unprecedented leak by lameduck Democrats is proof they are playing a political game they are losing," said Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung.
   
      He added, "If this injustice can happen to President Trump, it can happen to all Americans without cause."
   
      The Ways and Means Committee report concluded that the IRS failed to audit Trump's taxes as required under the mandatory presidential audit program. The report found that Trump was only audited one year from 2015-2020. "The Committee's investigation revealed only one mandatory audit was started under the prior Administration and the program was otherwise dormant, at best," the committee wrote in its 25-page report released Tuesday after the committee hearing.
   
      The committee found that the IRS was under-resourced to handle the presidential audit program, recommending additional staffing including "two senior IRS agents, a partnership specialist, a foreign specialist, and a financial products specialist." 
   
      Neal also wouldn't say if he saw any red flags in Trump's taxes â either on his business or personal filings. "I think we need to leave that to the tax folks," he said.
   
      Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the committee, attacked Democrats for weaponizing Trump's financial information. Brady said that the committee voted to release Trump's returns for six years, along with returns from eight affiliated businesses. 
   
      "What became clear is that almost all those audits that the IRS is doing is not yet complete. So any characterizations of the returns themselves, you have to acknowledge, this is incomplete at this time," Brady said.
   
      The highly anticipated meeting, which began publicly but quickly entered into a closed, private session, was years in the making but comes as Democrats have just days to act on whether to release the former president's tax returns. While there is historic precedent for Ways and Means to release confidential tax information, a decision to put it out to the public comes with intense political fallout as Trump has already declared he is running for president in 2024. 
   
      The committee has had access to Trump's taxes for weeks after winning a lengthy legal battle that began in the spring of 2019. Neal requested the first six years of Trump's taxes as well as tax returns for eight of his businesses back in April of 2019. 
   
      Brady, the panel's top Republican, told reporters just before Tuesday's meeting that releasing Trump's tax returns would amount to "a dangerous new political weapon that reaches far beyond the former president and overturns decades of privacy protections for average Americans that have existed since the Watergate reform."
   
      "We are unified in our concern the Democrats may today move forward with unprecedented action that will jeopardize the right of every American to be protected from political targeting by Congress," Brady said.
   
      Democrats on the committee would rely on section 6103 of the tax code to lawfully release information about Trump's taxes, but Republicans are prepared to argue that Democrats are abusing the provision, attacking a political enemy and potentially unleashing a system where even individuals could have their personal information exposed if they become targets of the committee.
   
      The Joint Committee on Taxation also raised many questions about the validity of Trump's claims in his tax returns.
   
      For example, Trump included many gigantic tax deductions for charitable donations that the JCT said merited further investigation.
   
      
      Hear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump
     
      In 2015, Trump claimed a $21.1 million deduction for donating 158 acres of his 212-acre property called Seven Springs in North Castle, New York. The donation is included in the Manhattan district attorney's criminal investigation of the Trump Organization's finances.
   
      The report noted that an IRS agent assigned to audit Trump's taxes suggested disallowing the entire $21.1 million deduction because Trump did not get a qualified appraisal for the land. The agent alternatively suggested reducing the value of the deduction by more than half and said the appraiser may be subject to a fine for potentially misstating the value of the land.
   
      In 2016 and 2017, Trump claimed nearly $1.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, in charitable contributions, the bulk of which were made in cash. Trump had no taxable income in either year, but he was able to carry forward the deduction to future years, further limiting the amount of federal income tax he had to pay. The JCT said the large cash contributions merited a review.
   
      Trump had taxable income in 2018 and 2019 and reported cash donations of just over $500,000 each year. That means he was able to claim a charitable contribution deduction those years. The JCT suggested Trump should be asked to substantiate those large cash donations.
   
      When Neal requested Trump's tax information in 2019, he wasn't the first chairman to use an arcane section of the tax code known as 6013 to glean confidential tax information. The same statute has been used a number of times by Ways and Means chairmen for investigations and the Joint Committee on Taxation also used the statute to obtain information about former President Richard Nixon's taxes in the 1970s. 
   
      According to the House Ways and Means Committee, that information was requested and received without a legal fight. Nixon had voluntarily released some of his returns, but JCT requested additional returns using 6103, according to a House Ways and Means Committee memo released earlier this summer. Republicans have also used the 6103 statute. Back in 2014, Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp led the committee in releasing confidential tax information to further the committee's investigation into whether the IRS had unfairly targeted conservative organizations when deciding on groups to probe.
   
      Although The New York Times obtained decades of Trump's personal tax information back in 2020, Neal's request could shed light on additional years of Trump's finances and paint a picture of how the former president used his business entities and personal wealth in the years before and after becoming president. 
   
      Trump broke with tradition in 2016 by refusing to release any of his personal tax returns. 
   
      Democrats have long argued that Trump's taxes could provide necessary information about whether the president had any entanglements that could impact his decision making as president. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee argued in court they needed Trump's tax returns so they could understand better the presidential audit program, which is supposed to routinely audit the returns of every incoming president and vice president when they are elected. 
   
      Neal didn't just request Trump's raw tax return, however. Neal also requested administrative files and paperwork, items that could include IRS officials' notes or audits of Trump's returns. The information could paint a picture of what kind of scrutiny the IRS has pursued on Trump in the past and whether any of that scrutiny changed when he became president. 
   
      When the returns are made public, they could shed light on how wealthy Trump really is, how much he gave to charity and how much he paid in taxes. The New York Times report in 2020 made clear that Trump carried over business losses for years to legally be able to avoid paying taxes for many of those years, but Ways and Means will have access to some additional years of Trump taxes as well.

      Children among dead as stranded Rohingya face starvation at sea, families say
    
**************************
 
      Many Rohingya are feared dead at sea more than three weeks after their boat became stranded off the Indian coast, where at least 160 people remain aboard on the brink of starvation, family members and the United Nations' refugee agency said.
   
      Mohammed Rezuwan Khan, whose sister and 5-year-old niece are on the vessel, told CNN Wednesday that two children and a woman had died, adding that those still alive have "no water, food or medicine."
   
      "We are extremely concerned and want them to be rescued. It's growing increasingly difficult for them to survive," said Khan, adding that he last spoke to the boat's captain on Sunday.
   
      The boat, currently near the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal, has reportedly been adrift since late November when its engine cut out. 
   
      It is thought to have been heading to Malaysia from Bangladesh, where around 1 million Rohingya, a stateless Muslim minority, live in refugee camps after fleeing violence in their native Myanmar.
   
      CNN cannot independently verify whether any deaths have occurred on the boat. A United Nations spokesman said there were "unverified reports suggesting at least 20 people may have already died during this shocking ordeal."
   
      Babar Baloch, an Asia spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), urged both India and Sri Lanka to help rescue those aboard.
   
      "Quick action is needed to save lives and avoid further deaths," Baloch said. "We repeat our warning that inaction from states to save lives is resulting in more human misery and tragedies with each passing day." 
   
      A group of Southeast Asian lawmakers has also urged neighboring countries to "urgently rescue" the boat, according to a statement from ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights. 
   
      The appeal comes days after the Sri Lankan Navy rescued a boat carrying 104 Rohingya refugees. 
   
      CNN has reached out to the Indian and Sri Lankan navies for comment.  
   
      Baloch said the UN believes some 2,000 Rohingya have taken the risky sea journey this year alone.
   
      Many leave from the overcrowded refugee camps of Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, where conditions are dire and women are at risk of sexual assault and violence. 
   
      The camps have swelled over the past five years as hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled a brutal campaign of killing and arson by the Myanmar military in western Rakhine state.
   
      Life at the camps has its own dangers. Fires are frequent and have destroyed hundreds of homes, while floods during the monsoon season often wipe out the poorly built huts. 
   
      
      Myanmar genocide case over Rohingya atrocities can go ahead, top UN court rules
     
      Desperate to leave, many pay illegal traffickers to smuggle them out of the camps. 
   
      Khan said his sister was in search of a better life for her daughter, and decided to attempt the dangerous sea journey out of Bangladesh on November 25. 
   
      "The Rohingya people are growing desperate, they are willing to risk their lives," Khan said. 
   
      The perilous voyage from Cox's Bazaar to Malaysia can take weeks, and conditions at sea are challenging. 
   
      Many on the stranded boat are drinking rain water when they can, Khan said, adding some are growing so desperate, they are drinking water from the ocean. 
   
      Rahan Uddin said his 17-year-old brother was also on the boat, having boarded in the hope of finding a job and earning enough money to help with his ailing parents' medical bills. 
   
      "We are very concerned about him and his safety," Uddin said. "We don't know if he is alive or not." 
   
      While all countries are bound by international law to rescue people in distress at sea, swift action is not always forthcoming â particularly where Rohingya refugees are concerned. 
   
      In December last year, Indonesia agreed to help repair a stranded boat packed with more than 100 Rohingya refugees off its coast, but did not allow its passengers to seek refuge in the country. 
   
      In March 2020, a larger boat carrying almost 300 Rohingya spent more than six months adrift at sea. Its passengers were turned away by several countries before finally being accepted by Indonesia. By then, at least 30 people including women and children had died. Many surviving women said they were assaulted on board the vessel.
   
      
      Myanmar Fast Facts
     
      Last year, India's Supreme Court ruled that Rohingya refugees in India could be forcibly returned to Myanmar. 
   
      India is not party to the UN Refugee Convention and lacks a national refugee protection structure, according to the UNHCR. Rohingya refugees are often labeled illegal immigrants subject to deportation from India.
   
      Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been criticized for trying to send back Rohingya over the years. 
   
      Khan said he wants the international community "to please see us as human beings." 
   
      "Let our people disembark from the boat," he said. "Please save the Rohingya. Otherwise, we may die." 
   
  Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified the spokesman's UN agency. It is the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

      8 teenage girls charged with second-degree murder in fatal stabbing of Toronto man
    
**************************
 
      Eight teenage girls were charged with murder Tuesday in the stabbing death of a 59-year-old Toronto man in what police are calling a "swarming" attack. 
   
      The man was found stabbed Sunday shortly after 12 a.m., following a report of an assault in the area of York Street and University Avenue. The man was taken to a nearby hospital where he later died, police said. Authorities did not release the man's name pending family notification.
   
      The eight girls were found shortly after the attack and taken into custody and charged with second-degree murder, Detective Sgt. Terry Browne of the Toronto Police Service Homicide Unit said during a news conference Tuesday.
   
      Three of the girls are 13, three of them are 14, and two of them are 16, according to a news release from the Toronto Police Service.
   
      The group of teenagers "met each other through social media. They come from varying parts of the city," Browne said Tuesday.
   
      "We don't know how or why they met on that evening and why that destination was downtown Toronto," Browne said, adding police believe the group may have been involved in an "altercation" earlier in the evening before the stabbing.
   
      Browne said he would not call the group of girls a "gang" but noted they participated in a behavior known as "swarming," in which multiple attackers target a victim simultaneously. A number of weapons were also found with the girls, Browne added.
   
      Three of the girls have had "prior contact" with police, Browne said.

      Britain is being hit by a wave of strikes. How did things get so bad?
    
**************************
 
      Another day, another round of strikes in Britain. 
   
      As the Christmas holidays approach, railway workers have brought the transport network to a standstill. Border Force staff are preparing to walk out. Postal workers, bus drivers and civil servants are either in the middle of strike action or threatening to strike.
   
      This week, nurses staged their biggest walkout in decades. And on Wednesday, paramedics are on strike in many parts of England, in a particularly bitter dispute that will bring further turmoil to an already ravaged public health system.
   
      The public have been urged to only call ambulances if they absolutely need to. âDon't get so drunk that you end up with an unnecessary visit to A&E," Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, told the BBC.
   
      But Wednesday's strike heaps further pressure on the government, which has been accused of disregarding the calls of workers. Health Secretary Steve Barclay told the Daily Telegraph that ambulance workers have "taken a conscious choice to inflict harm on patients," comments that drew the ire of workers and unions.
   
      A collection of individual disputes across various sectors have coalesced into a broader sense that something has gone very wrong in Britain, with workers saying that their pay, conditions and ability to provide essential services have been compromised by years of cuts and underinvestment.
   
      How have things got to such a nadir?
   
      Thursday's strike by ambulance workers, who are demanding a pay rise in line with inflation, comes after thousands of nurses walked out on 15 and 20 December.
   
      It is not just health and emergency services that are affected; virtually all forms of travel have been affected in some ways by strike or are expected to be in coming weeks â along with education, the criminal justice system, the postal service and a host of other fields. 
   
      Each workforce has complaints specific to their sectors that have brought them to the picket line. But the wave of strikes must also be viewed in light of the UK's long-running economic and societal stagnation, which has left workers desperate for a better deal.
   
      A cost of living crisis and soaring inflation have left Britons worse off this year. When adjusted for inflation, wages in the UK have fallen at one of the sharpest rates since records began in 2001, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). 
   
      And Britain's public sector workers in particular are bearing the brunt; average pay growth in the private sector was 6.9% in the middle of 2022, compared to 2.7% for the public sector â the ONS said this gulf is "among the largest differences between the private sector and public sector growth rates we have seen."
   
      Still, for many striking workers, anger can be traced back further than the current economic crises.
   
      Since former Prime Minister David Cameron's austerity program saw budgets for public services slashed, employees have complained of a decline in many of Britain's local agencies and institutional safety nets.
   
      Funding for local councils and schools slumped over the course of the 2010s, a decade of decline that critics say has held Britain back, leaving a gaping wound in the services parents, children and citizens rely on every day.
   
      The aftershocks of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic further tightened the purse-strings and complicated a cautious effort to emerge from the tight-fisted approach that defined the 2010s. 
   
      More recently, instability at the heart of government â Britain is on its fifth Prime Minister in six years â and a disastrous financial program unveiled by shambolic ex-PM Liz Truss have dashed many Brits' hopes that the public sector will get a boost in the near future.
   
      Strikes in the National Health Service â a pillar of Britain's national identity and one of the world's most lauded governmental programs â are rare.
   
      Until this month, the UK's largest nursing union had never called a walkout in its 106-year history. Wednesday's ambulance strike is the first such action since 1990.
   
      There are some concerns about the level of service that will continue during the strike. Members of the armed forces are being deployed in an effort to relieve the impact, and health minister Will Quince suggested on BBC Radio that people should avoid contact sport or other "risky activity" while ambulance services are disrupted, comments that were roundly criticized as flippant. 
   
      
      British nurses launch historic strike, as pay and staffing crises threaten the NHS
     
      But workers in the NHS have been pushed to the brink in recent years, with a staffing crisis, low pay and skyrocketing waiting lists leaving hospitals and wards crammed full and staff exhausted.
   
      Brits must now wait an average of one hour for an ambulance if they've reported a suspected heart attack, stroke or other similar issues, despite an 18-minute national target. The wait for a "Category 1" call, which relates to immediate threats to life, is up to 10 minutes, despite a seven-minute target. 
   
      Conditions do not always improve while a patient arrives in hospital, where waiting times are at record levels. Every day, across the country, ambulances can be seen lined up outside emergency departments, waiting to discharge their patients.
   
      In the West Midlands area of England, one person died after an ambulance delay in the whole of 2020. In the first nine months of 2022, that  figure had soared to 37, according to the BBC's Newsnight program, which obtained the figures through a Freedom of Information request.
   
      "The reality is, every day, nurses across the UK are walking into understaffed hospitals," Andrea Mackay, who has worked as a nurse for seven years at a hospital in southwest England, told CNN on her reasons for striking last week. 
   
      "During one of my worst shifts I was the only nurse to 28 unwell children," added Jessie Collins, a pediatric nurse. "It's not safe and we cannot deliver the care that these children need at times."
   
      This wave of strikes is the biggest to hit Britain in a decade, and the sheer number of services being affected has drawn comparisons to the so-called winter of discontent of 1978 to 1979.
   
      That period followed bitter pay disputes between the government and both the public and private sector; following her 1979 election victory, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher waged a largely victorious battle with many of Britain's unions, severely diminishing their power.
   
      In reality, the strikes of 2022 have caused a fraction of the impact that those did. 
   
      A total of 417,000 working days were lost to strikes in October, the most recent month for which figures are available, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) â a far cry from the several million days lost at the end of the 1970s. 
   
      But October's figure is the highest number for any month since 2011, and virtually all pay disputes seem far from resolved, stoking fears that next year will be one of mass disruption.
   
      The government of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says it cannot afford the pay demands being made by the public sector unions. In the case of railway strikes, it has said the onus is on private train companies to resolve the disputes â despite the fact that the government controls the purse-strings, having bailed out the network during the Covid-19 pandemic.
   
      But the ongoing disruption is a major headache for Sunak, who took over from Truss with the promise of a sensible and restrained approach to Britain's stuttering economy.
   
      Opinion polls show the government is shouldering much of the blame for the spate of labor unrest, and that the public is generally sympathetic towards striking workers. 
   
      Ministers have repeatedly taken a firm line, refusing to bow to the demands of any one union â opening itself up to criticism that it is not making enough effort bring an end to the strife.
   
      Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer attacked Sunak on the nursing strike in Parliament last week, telling him that "the whole country would breathe a sigh of relief" if he halted the strike by striking a deal with the RCN.
   
      The industrial action was a "a badge of shame for this government," Starmer said.
   
      His party, which has historical links to several unions, is walking a delicate line on the strikes; Starmer has refused to explicitly support unions' demands, but has pointed to their walkouts as evidence that the Conservatives have stalled the economy.
   
      Those arguments will be tested even further over the Christmas period and in the New Year, and public opinion will be vital in strengthening the government's hand or forcing them to the negotiating table.

      Thai warship that sank, killing 6, had too few life jackets, admiral says
    
**************************
 
      Thai naval officials said Tuesday there were not enough life jackets for everyone aboard a warship that sank early Monday in severe weather in the Gulf of Thailand with the loss of at least six lives.
   
      Twenty-three people remain missing after the sinking of the corvette HTMS Sukhothai, while 76 people have been rescued, commander-in-chief of the Royal Thai Navy Adm. Cherngchai Chomcherngpat told a news conference.
   
      The ship was carrying 105 people at the time of the sinking, 30 more than usual, and there were not enough life jackets for all of them, Cherngchai said. 
   
      The extra officers were aboard because the ship was taking part in a salute to the founder of the Thai navy, the admiral said, adding: "Normally more life jackets must be added for additional officers." 
   
      The crew were "fully aware about the problem of not having enough life jackets for 30 additional officers. They tried to use other tools which could save the lives of officers who didn't have life jackets," the admiral said.
   
      Some of those without life jackets tried to escape on inflatable rafts, some of which were stored aboard the corvette and some of which were dropped by rescue helicopters and other ships.
   
      Of the 30 people without life jackets, 18 have been rescued and the rest are still missing, the admiral said. 
   
      "With or without life jacket (it) doesn't affect the odds of surviving," he added.
   
      He said the ship sank after seawater entered and disabled its power systems.
   
      Waves were between 3 and 4 meters (10 feet to 13 feet) high at the time and the water temperature was about 29 degrees Celsius (84 degress Fahrenheit).
   
      Water entered the front portion of the 252-foot (76.8-meter) long warship around 8:45 p.m. Sunday, Cherngchai said.
   
      The flooding continued for more than three hours, eventually disabling the ship's engine and electrical systems and dooming efforts to pump it out.
   
      Rescue teams in helicopters tried to lower water pumps to the ship but the efforts were thwarted as it began to tilt heavily.
   
      The admiral dismissed a suggestion that the almost 40-year-old ship might not have been in proper shape to handle the high seas, saying it had been upgraded several times in recent years.

      Exclusive: Pelosiâs California home didnât receive security review in four years before Octoberâs violent attack, Capitol Police chief says
    
**************************
 
      Before the violent attack on her husband in late October, the security of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's California home had not been assessed by United States Capitol Police since 2018, Police Chief Thomas Manger told CNN's Pamela Brown in an exclusive interview Tuesday. 
   
      Lawmakers have pressed for answers about security lapses on the night of October 28, when the alleged assailant broke into the couple's San Francisco home and attacked Paul Pelosi with a hammer. According to court documents, he had been looking for the speaker, who was in Washington at the time.
   
      In a November letter exclusively obtained by CNN, Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, the chair of the House Administration Committee, asked the USCP for detailed answers about the lack of security at the Pelosis' home, including why the residence had not received an assessment in the previous four years. 
   
      
      'I never thought it would be Paul': Nancy Pelosi reveals how she first heard her husband had been attacked
     
      It's unclear what recommendations Capitol Police made in 2018 and which ones were approved by Congress to be implemented. But the USCP has assessed the Pelosis' home since the attack and will perform the security assessments more frequently, Manger told CNN.
   
      "Anytime there's a change in leadership position, we will do an updated assessment," Manger said, noting that members can also request the security assessments. 
   
      Pelosi communications director Henry Connelly told CNN her office would not discuss security matters in response to questions about whether she had previously requested those assessments. 
   
      In 2021, Pelosi was the subject of 632 threat cases opened by the USCP, according to Lofgren's letter, more than 6% of all threat cases overseen by Capitol Police last year. At least 24 of those threats were presented to the Justice Department for possible prosecution, according to the letter. 
   
      "We had more folks focused on her safety than any other member of Congress because of the number of threats that she had," Manger said of security for the California Democrat, who is heavily monitored both in and outside of Washington, DC. Democrats lost control of the House in last month's midterm elections, and Pelosi did not seek reelection to caucus leadership.
   
      Manger said the USCP needs to enhance the "security posture" for whomever the speaker of the House is or for any member who has received the number of threats Pelosi has. 
   
      
      Frustrated lawmakers want protection for their families as threats increase
     
      "The level of violence in our country directed toward political officials, government officials, it's really at a point where I think that it's as dangerous as it's ever been to be an elected official," Manger said, noting the number of threats has only increased since his appointment in July 2021.
   
      Threats and violence against members of Congress are not new. Democratic then-Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona was almost killed after being shot in the head in 2011 and Republican Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana was shot and wounded during practice for a congressional charity baseball game in 2017. But politicians from both parties, as well as election officials, have received a spate of recent and increasing threats.
   
      When pressed whether Capitol Police would be providing more security for members and their immediate families, Manger said it was looking at ways to "beef up" security for lawmakers when they are in Washington and to protect their residences in their home districts, though he declined to offer specifics. 
   
      He acknowledged an ongoing concern is ensuring the safety of lawmakers when they're out in their districts. "We've got to make sure that we do a better job at working with the state and local police to put things in place ahead of time, not wait for a crisis, not wait for a threat," Manger said, adding that the USCP is building relationships with local law enforcement to communicate about the movements of lawmakers and any threats they may face.
   
      The Capitol Police has worked to fill hundreds of job vacancies, hiring 280 officers this year, and has also contracted 40 to 50 unarmed guards who check security badges and credentials for individuals already inside the Capitol.
   
      Despite their renewed efforts, however, Manger noted that threat levels aren't something the Capitol Police can control.  
   
      "It's just the sheer volume of what we're dealing with now versus what we dealt with years ago," Manger said. "I'm not so sure that the Capitol Police can do a lot to tamp that down. So our responsibility is we've just got to deal with the growing number."

      Football, gas and bribery allegations: How Qatar-EU relations deteriorated
    
**************************
 
  Editor's Note: A version of this story appears in today's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, CNN's three-times-a-week look inside the region's biggest stories. Sign up here.
 
      As the world's attention was focused on the conclusion of the World Cup in Qatar last week, a political scandal was brewing in Europe with the small gas-rich nation at its center.  
   
      Authorities in Belgium arrested four people on December 9 under suspicion of having received gifts and favors from Qatar as part of efforts to influence decision-making at the European Parliament. 
   
      Politicians and commentators in Europe described the incident as the biggest corruption scandal to hit  politics on the continent. Lawmakers suspended Qatar's access to the European Parliament and put on hold legislation related to aviation and visa liberalization. 
   
      Doha has strongly denied involvement, warning that the decision to "impose such a discriminatory restriction" on Qatar before the legal process has ended could impact cooperation. 
   
      The scandal is the latest dent in the Gulf nation's relations with European countries after deep differences over Qatar's hosting of the FIFA World Cup simmered recently. 
   
      Here's what you need to know about the turbulence in Qatari-European relations: 
   
      What is the bribery scandal that has rocked the EU and how has Qatar reacted? 
   
      Belgium's federal prosecutor said earlier this month that for two years, federal police inspectors "suspected a country from the Persian Gulf of influencing economic and political decisions of the European Parliament," according to public broadcaster RTBF. 
   
      Of the four people who were subsequently arrested, the most high-profile individual is Greek lawmaker Eva Kaili, who was stripped of her role as one of the parliament's 14 vice presidents on Tuesday.   
   
      A lawyer for Kaili's family, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos, told CNN Tuesday that her position "remains that she is innocent and that she has nothing to do with bribery from Qatar."  
   
      Qatar has hit back, accusing those involved in the investigation of leaking "inaccurate information." It has also protested being singled out in the investigation before its conclusion. 
   
      "Qatar was not the only party named in the investigation, yet our country has been exclusively criticized and attacked," a Qatari diplomat said in a statement on Sunday. 
   
      Where does Qatar's relationship with the EU stand today? 
   
      Qatar has largely dominated European headlines this year for two reasons: Gas and football.  
   
      The controversies surrounding its hosting of the World Cup have attracted bad press in Europe, which Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani has described as a "ferocious" campaign against his country and questioned "the real reasons and motives" behind it. 
   
      
      Why some Arabs and Muslims feel stung by coverage of the Qatar World Cup
     
      European states participating in the tournament made their positions clear from their capitals as well as on the football pitch and in the stands. German players covered their mouths in a pre-match photo in protest over a ban on wearing rainbow-colored armbands, a planned statement against Qatar's anti-LGBTQ rules. A German minister wore the "OneLove" armband at the same game in defiance of restrictions on LGBTQ symbols. 
   
      But criticism of the tournament in the Western press went beyond LGBTQ issues and the plight of migrant workers in Qatar, prompting regional activists and journalists to accuse Western media of anti-Arab prejudice. 
   
      "The cultural rifts that have emerged in Europe during the World Cup are not specific to Qatar but affect the wider Gulf," said Andreas Krieg, an associate professor at King's College London. "What is happening to Qatar is seen as European privilege, closed-mindedness, Islamophobia and racism." 
   
      Qatar's role as a potential replacement for Russian energy supplies has also been touted in Europe as the continent tries to wean itself off Moscow's gas following its war on Ukraine. That could magnify the effect of any strain on Qatari-European relationships, said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute in Houston, Texas. 
   
      "There is a more assertive mood in Dohaâ¦ borne out of a feeling that European states more than ever are seen to be seeking energy and investment from the Gulf even as coverage over the World Cup has in the view of many across the region been deeply offensive in its tone," he told CNN. 
   
      Qatar, which has the third biggest gas reserves in the world after Russia and Iran, will stand "in solidarity" with Europe amid a gas shortage, Energy Minister Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi told CNN in March. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said earlier this year that Qatar will play a "central role" in his country's energy strategy and the Gulf nation signed its first gas deal with Berlin last month. 
   
      Qatar is also a major investor in Europe. It is one of the biggest property owners in the United Kingdom and owns trophy assets in London such as the Harrods department store and the Shard skyscraper, as well as a 20% stake in Heathrow airport. In France, the second-biggest destination for Qatari investments, it has over $26 billion in assets, and has created about 72,000 jobs.  
   
      Is Qatar likely to retaliate against the EU as relations take a dive? 
   
      Qatar has expressed concern about the "wave of attacks" it is facing in European media. 
   
      After news of the bribery scandal broke, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola delivered a scathing attack on the "enemies of democracy" in an address to the legislature. She suggested that the bloc was ready to sacrifice its burgeoning energy ties with Qatar as a result. "We are Europeans," she said. "We'd rather be cold than bought." 
   
      
      Europe can't live without Russian gas. Can this tiny Middle East country help?  
     
      Qatar has been keen to dispel the notion that it would weaponize its vast gas reserves. When its neighbors, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, imposed a boycott designed to cripple its economy in 2017, Doha continued to supply the UAE with gas. Qatar's friendly relations with Iran can be attributed to gas diplomacy, too. The two nations share the world's biggest gas field, known in Qatar as the North Field. 
   
      In a statement to CNN, Qatar noted its position as an important supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Belgium and warned the EU that the ongoing episode could affect "discussions around global energy poverty." 
   
      But Qatar could find other ways to let its grievance with Europe be known. After London's transport authority banned Qatari advertisements in protest of its position on LGBTQ issues, for example, Doha began a review of its investments in the city, the Financial Times reported. 
   
      Qatar didn't respond to CNN's request for comment for this article.  
   
      Ulrichsen said European officials and diplomats have tried to push back against the negativity of media coverage during the World Cup. French President Emmanuel Macron made a very public appearance at the tournament, attending the semifinal and final matches. When Qatar's Sheikh Tamim handed out medals to the tournament's Argentinian winners on Sunday, Macron was by his side. 
   
      Krieg said Qatar's signing of a gas contract with Germany suggests that it isn't going to politicize business dealings. 
   
      "I think the current warnings expressed by Qatar are a show of force and are unlikely going to translate into quid pro quos. Qatar has no tradition of playing hardball," said Krieg. "They tend to be accommodating but patience has run low. And Europeans would do well to take Qatari and Gulf concerns into consideration." 
   
      Sweden's blocking of Turkish man's extradition "very negative," Ankara says 
   
      The Swedish Supreme Court's decision to block the extradition of Turkish journalist Bulent Kenes is a "very negative" development, Turkey's foreign minister said  Tuesday, as Stockholm seeks Ankara's approval for it to join NATO, Reuters reported. Sweden's Foreign Ministry said it was bound to act in accordance with the court's ruling. 
   
      Russia to give Iran "advanced military components" in return for drones â UK official 
   
      Russia is to provide Iran with "advanced military components" in return for 300 Iranian Kamikaze drones it already received, UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace warned  Tuesday, adding that Tehran  has become "one of Russia's top military backers." Wallace did not provide any further details. 
   
      Iran's foreign minister says he spoke to Saudi counterpart at Jordan conference 
   
      Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian tweeted on Wednesday that he held "friendly talks" with his Saudi counterpart on the sidelines of a conference in Jordan the previous day, in what would be the highest-level encounter between officials from the rival states since they cut ties in 2016, Reuters reported. "My Saudi counterpart assured me of his country's willingness to continue the dialog with Iran," he tweeted. 
   
      The UAE expects its economy to grow 7.6% this year, state news agency WAM said Monday. In contrast, the International Monetary Fund projects the global economy to grow 3.2%. The US economy meanwhile is expected to grow about 1.8%. One of the world's top oil producers, the UAE benefited from high crude prices earlier this year following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
   
      Regional: #Bisht 
   
      The Qatari emir's placing of the Arab "bisht" cloak around Argentinian footballing legend Lionel Messi's shoulders after his team won the World Cup became the subject of an intense online debate. 
   
      The term was trending in several Arab countries, and it quickly became the subject of internet memes, with Arabs taking pride in the entire tournament and particularly the closing ceremony carrying a distinctly Middle Eastern flavor.  
   
      But not everyone shared that joy. Critics of the move decried it as a publicity stunt on Qatar's part, saying that the moment should belong to the winning players, not the hosts. "Grossly indulgent," Laurie Whitwell, a sports journalist, tweeted.  
   
      Many Arabs however felt targeted by the controversy, countering that awarding of a bisht was the highest mark of bestowing honor and prestige in Arab culture. 
   
      Sultan Al Musa, a writer from Saudi Arabia, suggested that the controversy around Messi's wearing of the cloak  likely had to do with its "Arab connotations," pointing out that other instances of sportsmen wearing cultural items of clothing are considered signs of "cultural coexistence." The post was retweeted almost 6,000 times. 
   
      Conservative Kuwaiti lawmaker Waleed Al Tabtabaie called the bisht gifting and Qatar's hosting of the tournament as the "pinnacle of creativity" in trying to reverse what he said was an attempt by Hollywood to distort the image of Arabs and Muslims as backward and violent. 
   
      Others shared images of Argentinian fans buying bishts in the markets of Doha as a testament to their appreciation of the emir's gesture towards Messi.

      Chinaâs Covid âchaosâ: How a shortage of fever drugs is sparking a global run on medicines

            Latest Market News 
	

 
      An unprecedented wave of Covid infections in China has triggered widespread drug shortages, as people scramble to buy fever medicines and painkillers to alleviate flu-like symptoms.
   
      The panic buying has spread outside mainland China's borders, with the generic versions of Tylenol and Advil sold out at drugstores in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and as far afield as Australia, prompting some local pharmacies to limit sales. Even home remedies such as canned peaches are being snapped up by people looking for ways to fight Covid.
   
      The situation mirrors shortages seen in the United States and Canada over children's painkillers, which are in high demand because of the proliferation of respiratory viruses.
   
      The health chief of Hong Kong, a special administrative region with a separate system of government from the Chinese mainland, urged the public to refrain from hoarding cold medicines, asking them "not to overact."
   
      At five drugstores in the commercial district of Wan Chai, the drug Panadol, the local brand name for Tylenol, has been sold out for two weeks, salespersons told CNN. One salesman, who gave his name as Simon, said the shortage was due to buyers purchasing in bulk to send to their friends and relatives in the mainland.
   
      When his store does manage to get hold of some supply, he is able to provide delivery to longstanding customers in China through a complex process that takes about two weeks, costing between HK$150 ($19) to HK$200 ($26) per 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds).
   
      "We send the drugs by mail to Macao, where our agents pick it up and then hand deliver it across the border to Zhuhai," he said, adding that the couriers must quarantine once they arrive on the mainland. Macao is another special administrative region of China, while Zhuhai is a southern mainland Chinese city which it borders.
   
      Current rules don't allow medicines to be mailed directly from Hong Kong to mainland China, according to the salespersons. Sending agents directly from Hong Kong, which also shares a land border with the mainland, isn't feasible due to a lack of available agents, Simon said. 
   
      In Macao, the drug regulator ordered pharmacies last week to limit purchases of pain relievers, fever medicines and antigen test kits. The order came after residents complained about empty shelves when they were looking for cold and fever medicines, according to Exmoo News, a local newspaper.
   
      
      Why people in China are panic buying canned yellow peaches as Covid surges
     
      China is grappling with its worst outbreak since the start of the pandemic, with analysts from investment bank Nomura describing the situation as "nationwide chaos."
   
      "In all of this, one big question is whether the current reopening was planned," said analysts from Capital Economics in a separate note. "It seems that the wider state apparatus had not seen a shift coming." 
   
      On Monday, national authorities started announcing the first Covid-related deaths since the easing of pandemic restrictions on December 7. Only a few deaths have been reported, even as social media posts have pointed to a surge in demand at Beijing's funeral homes and long lines at the city's hospitals and fever clinics.
   
      With health services overwhelmed, Chinese citizens have turned to personal networks around the world to secure Covid supplies. 
   
      A CNN journalist visited a dozen drugstores in various districts across Taipei on Tuesday night, without managing to find a single box of Panadol. Mr Lin, a shop assistant at the Kawaki Drug Store in the center of the city, said demand surged over the past two weeks. 
   
      "We have always faced a supply shortage of Panadol since the Covid-19 outbreak, but the situation has become a lot more acute," he said. "Some customers told us that they wanted to send the pills to their relatives and friends in China, given the situation there." 
   
      I Li-chen, a pharmacist in Taipei's Xinyi district, said her drugstore had received many questions about Panadol pills recently. 
   
      "Some people wanted to buy the pills because they wanted to send them to relatives in China, while others needed them because they had to visit China soon," she said.
   
      Even as far as Australia, which has cities with large populations of ethnic Chinese residents, some concerned Chinese Australians have begun sending over-the-counter cold and flu medicines to family members back in China, according to ABC News.

      YouTubers, doping and greed: Itâs been a tough year for boxing
    
**************************
 
      Simiso Buthelezi, Miracle Amaeze and Luis QuiÃ±ones are some of the talented boxers who have died this year as they pursued their sporting careers and chased dreams of world titles. 
   
      It's an accepted risk of the profession. A database first compiled by anti-boxing activist Manuel Velazquez and updated in the Electronic Journal of Martial Arts and Sciences estimated 1,604 boxers died as a direct result of injuries sustained in the ring between 1890 and 2011 â an average of 13 deaths a year.  
   
      That's a shocking statistic for a professional sport, but perhaps not altogether that surprising. As Stephanie Alessi-LaRosa, director of Hartford Healthcare's sports neurology program, points out, it's a boxer's objective in a fight "to neurologically impair the opponent."  
   
      The NFL and soccer are two notable sports grappling with the implications of concussion, but boxing even more so.
   
      The acute concussions suffered by fighters when they are hit on the head are explained by Alessi-LaRosa as a "metabolic crisis" where a "functional disturbance of the brain" takes place.
   
      The consequences of continuous hits to the head can be catastrophic.
   
      Earlier this year, South African lightweight boxer Buthelezi appeared to turn away from his opponent and fight in the direction of an empty corner of the ring in the middle of a fight.  
   
      The referee stopped the fight immediately before Buthelezi was rushed to hospital. The South African boxer died days later.   
   
      Boxing has taken many strides to make the sport safer, such as reducing the total number of rounds and the introduction of sports neurologists, according to Alessi-LaRosa.
   
      However, she also thinks more needs to be done, notably educating fighters and parents about the neurological consequences of being a boxer.
   
      "I think if we can mandate â like how the NFL has â these neurotrauma consultants, or, if we can mandate somehow having a neurologist at every boxing â professional boxing at least â event, I think that would be a huge step," says Alessi-LaRosa.
   
      The health concerns stretch all the way to the top of boxing.
   
      Deontay Wilder is known as one of boxing's hardest punchers and he's lost just twice in his career.
   
      However, even Wilder was reduced to tears as he reflected on the dangers of his chosen profession earlier this year, referencing what happened to Prichard ColÃ³n when he fought Terrel Williams in 2015. Subsequently Colon was in a coma for 221 days having suffered brain bleeding.
   
      In a complaint filed in 2017 in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia by ColÃ³n's parents seeking more than $50 million from the ringside doctor and promoters connected to the fight, it said ColÃ³n had been left in a "persistent vegetative state requiring full time care." 
   
      "You all don't f**king understand what we go through, man," an emotional Wilder said to the media after his first-round knockout of Robert Helenius in October.  
   
      As well as the deaths in boxing this year, the sport's reputation has taken a battering over the handling of the highly-anticipated Chris Eubank Jr. and Conor Benn fight in October.
   
      The bout was called off after Benn tested positive for clomiphene, a fertility drug used by women who struggle to ovulate.
   
      According to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), clomiphene in men can potentially boost testosterone levels "by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis." The drug is also included on the World Anti-Doping Agency's prohibited list under anti-estrogenic substances.  
   
      Previously, UFC stars Brock Lesnar and Jon Jones have both been suspended for a year each after testing positive for clomiphene.  
   
      Benn's alleged rules violation emerged after a test done by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) which is a third-party testing agency used by the fighters to ensure a clean fight.  
   
      The British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) â the governing body for professional boxing in Great Britain â initially "prohibited" the fight after Benn's positive test was revealed, saying it was "not in the interests of boxing." 
   
      However, the bout's promoter, Matchroom, and that organization's boss, Eddie Hearn, were keen for the bout to go ahead.  
   
      Hearn told the BBC at the time: "As we stand right now, the British Boxing Board of Control is not sanctioning the fight. That does not mean the fight is off, but there is a process we have to go through. 
   
      "Conor Benn is not suspended, he is free and clear to fight. There's lots going on with the lawyers." 
   
      Amid mounting public pressure and safety concerns, the fight was ultimately canceled.  
   
      The decision to overlook potential safety concerns and stage a bout including a fighter who had tested positive for a banned substance prompted criticism that boxing prioritizes the fight's money-making opportunities rather than the boxers' safety.  
   
      CNN has reached out to Hearn and Matchroom to offer the opportunity to comment.
   
      Weeks later, the BBBofC claimed that Benn voluntarily relinquished his licence with the governing body just before allegations of misconduct against the 26-year-old were upheld.  
   
      Benn has consistently denied doping, also accusing the BBBofC of conducting an "unfair and biased procedure." He also disputes that the relinquished his license, saying rather that he'd allowed it to lapse since it was about to expire. 
   
      "(Benn) strongly refutes the allegation of misconduct (which for the avoidance of doubt is not in relation to the Vada issue) and firmly believes that an independent tribunal will reach a wholly different conclusion," a statement said on Benn's Twitter.  
   
      "At the appropriate time Conor will speak out on this and on the doping allegation, to the extent that he can whilst legal proceedings are ongoing. In the meantime he reiterates, in no uncertain terms, that he is a clean athlete."  
   
      CNN has reached out to the BBBofC, Benn and Eubank Jr. for comment. 
   
      In a statement, UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it was investigating the incident, saying it "acts on all reports of doping."  
   
      "UKAD takes all matters of suspected doping activity very seriously. We act on all reports of doping and encourage anyone with information on suspected doping activity to come forward and share that with us in confidence via our Protect Your Sport initiative," UKAD chief executive, Jane Rumble, said.   
   
      "UKAD will not comment publicly on the specific facts of any case that may or may not be ongoing. We do this to respect and ensure the confidentiality of information as required by the World Anti-Doping Code and other applicable laws and regulations.
   
      "Athletes know their rights and responsibilities when it comes to anti-doping and we will continue to work tirelessly to remove anyone from sport that breaks the rules."
   
      UKAD said it "can't offer a comment on any ongoing investigations" when approached by CNN for an update.  
   
      Amid deaths and failed drug tests, boxing is also facing new disruption from the rise of YouTubers â in particular Jake Paul, who is 6-0 in professional fights and has transitioned almost seamlessly from internet content creator to pro fighter.
   
      Who needs hardened professionals when you have fighters like Paul, who can also generate plenty of noise and social media buzz â as well as money. 
   
      Forbes estimated earlier this year that Paul earned a combined $40 million before taxes from his three boxing victories in 2021. 
   
      In November, Paul clashed with Tommy Fury's father, John, in Dubai after the latter boxer's victory over Daniel Bocianski in a scene which has been branded as "ridiculous" by boxing promotor Frank Warren. 
   
      Paul and Tommy Fury have been scheduled to fight twice, with the latter withdrawing both times. In the bout with Bocianski â which came on the undercard of Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s exhibition fight against UK YouTuber Deji â Paul could be heard goading Fury and criticizing his abilities.   
   
      After the fight, when Paul approached the ring, John Fury ripped his shirt off before unleashing a barrage of abuse aimed at the US YouTuber-turned-boxer. 
   
      The whole evening â between the ring-side incident and the nature of Mayweather's fight with Deji â has led to criticism of YouTubers' involvement in the sport. 
   
      Paul said in a tweet that Mayweather was "ruining the sport of boxing." In response, Mayweather said his "philosophy" was "currency over legacy." 
   
      Former professional boxer and writer Ed Latimore rejects the notion that boxing is facing an existential crisis.
   
      "I think boxing is experiencing the exact opposite of a state of decline," Latimore told CNN, citing recent research which suggests boxing is now amongst the top four sports in the US.  
   
      "If you look at what Jake Paul has done with his audience, he's brought a lot of people [fans] â¦ Now with streaming, there is DAZN and Top Rank and PBC [Premier Boxing Champions, a televised boxing series]. I think it's a good time in boxing, certainly in the next 10 to 20 years for sure."
   
      Ever since modern boxing's growth over the last half century, fans have been entertained by superstars like Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson and Mayweather.
   
      That trio of fighters grabbed the attention of the world, notably a couple of Ali's fights â the 1974 "Rumble in the Jungle" and the 1975 "Thrilla in Manila" â while Mayweather Jr.'s bout against Manny Pacquiao in 2015 was billed as "Fight of the Century."
   
      
      'The Fight of the Century': A divided US nation 50 years on
     
      In the 1990s, two clashes â one at super middleweight and one at middleweight â fights between Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank Sr. also gripped boxing fans. Eubank and Benn are the fathers of the two fighters whose fight was canceled in October.
   
      But in recent years, it seems that organizers have struggled to stage the title fights for which boxing fans have clamored. 
   
      In part, this is down to the convoluted negotiations between organizers, promoters and broadcasters. And with four boxing organizations, each with their own titles and champions, that only complicates matters further.
   
      As such, a fighter can be a champion in multiple organizations and not even ranked in others.
   
      Meanwhile, the unwillingness of some champion boxers â either undefeated or on long winning runs â to potentially lose their marketability by suffering a defeat has become another key stumbling block.
   
      "It's not like league sports where the brand is the league. In combat, the brand is the fighter. So when that fighter takes a loss, that cash cow falls off," explained Latimore.
   
      Latimore points to the 2015 fight between Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao which, he says, should have happened five years earlier.
   
      By the time the two stepped into the ring together, Mayweather was able to command a large slice of the purse â which totaled an eye-watering $300 million â because he had been able to maintain his status as an undefeated fighter; Pacquiao had lost twice in 2012 after a 15-win steak.  
   
      Four years ago, Wilder faced Tyson Fury in their first of what would be a trilogy of fights. Fury was coming off a three-year absence from the ring, while Wilder was the defending champion.
   
      According to the California State Athletic Commission, Wilder earned a base purse of $4 million, while Fury earned $3 million. That was arguably because Wilder was the main draw, with Fury the challenger and less marketable. 
   
      Devin Haney, the superstar US lightweight fighter, chose to leave his promoters to allow him to challenge George Kambosos Jr. for his WBA, IBF and WBO lightweight world titles and unify the division.  
   
      It was a decision that paid off for Haney, as he beat Kambosos Jr. twice in Australia, winning by unanimous decisions both times and outclassing him twice.  
   
      The fight boxing fans are eagerly anticipating at the moment is the welterweight clash between US stars Terrance Crawford and Errol Spence, due to take place in February 2023.
   
      It won't be happening any time soon, according to Latimore.
   
      "Or if it happens, it's going to happen after one of them loses and somebody has significant leverage â¦ it comes down to a business decision,'" said Latimore.
   
      "And I want to say this to be very clear: I don't think the fighters think this way. I really genuinely believe that Spence and Crawford are like: âLet's go, bang.'
   
      "But there's the contract and business end of it and the business end of it, very often at this level, when there's this much money involved and this much prestige involved â¦ the business end of it gets in the way."
   
      US star Ryan Garcia recently took to social media to vent his annoyance that a potential fight with Gervonta Davis was taking so long to organize. In November, Garcia and Davis announced their catchweight fight will take place in April, 2023 in Las Vegas.  
   
      One possible solution could be a UFC-style system â with a president, like Dana White, overseeing and arranging in-demand fights.
   
      "I think that would fix a lot of stuff," admits Latimore, before quickly adding, "but then you remove all the ways you can make money â¦ No one gives up power voluntarily. I do know that moving closer to any type of regulation is better for the fans."
   
      White himself has distanced himself from any involvement in boxing, calling it a "broken business."
   
      "Every time I try to think about doing something with boxing, I go: âWhy would I want to do this to myself?'" he said on Blockasset's BLOCK Party.
   
      "Why would I even want to dive into this nightmare? That's why I haven't really done anything. It's a broken business that is an absolute nightmare to try to fix."

      The UK just took a step closer to space flight

      The United Kingdom is one step closer to conducting its first ever satellite launch from its own shores. 
   
      The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), a regulatory body, said on Wednesday that it had granted the final licenses to Virgin Orbit to carry out the launch. 
   
      Virgin Orbit, a US subsidiary of Richard Branson's Virgin Group, plans to launch a rocket into space off of a modified Boeing 747 jet, named "Cosmic Girl." The rocket, which will be launched over the Atlantic Ocean, will carry nine satellites into orbit. 
   
      The company has already conducted four successful satellite launch missions in this way from California. 
   
      The development places the United Kingdom on track to become the first country in Europe to provide commercial launch services to small satellite makers, according to the government. 
   
      Britain has been working on commercial spaceports for several years in a bid to capture a bigger share of the rapidly growing space market, which Morgan Stanley estimates could be worth over $1 trillion by 2040.
   
      "Today we are one step closer to opening the UK's galactic gateway, with Virgin Orbit receiving an historic first license to allow the UK's first ever spaceflight launch," UK transport secretary Mark Harper said in a statement on Wednesday.
   
      The satellite launch is expected to take place from Spaceport Cornwall, a spaceflight launch site located on the UK's southwest coast, early next year. 
   
      Dan Hart, chief executive of Virgin Orbit, said in a statement that the company was "progressing towards the first launch from Cornwall â  keeping a strong focus on a safe and successful mission for all."
   
      The government estimates that the country's growing Â£16.5 billion ($14 billion) space industry will support around 47,000 jobs.
   
      The CAA said it granted Virgin Orbit the final remaining licenses after it met all necessary safety, security and environmental tests.

      Argentine stars Lionel Messi and Rodrigo De Paul fly in helicopter over parade due to crowd size
    
**************************
 
      Argentine national soccer team stars Lionel Messi and Rodrigo De Paul, along with coach Lionel Scaloni, were forced to fly in a helicopter over the center of Buenos Aires after their bus got stuck in the massive crowds gathered to watch the parade celebrating the country's World Cup victory, Argentine federal police said on Tuesday.
   
       A bus carrying the entire team departed from the Argentine Football Association's (AFA) headquarters and was set to head to the Obelisk, a historic monument in the capital.
   
      However, the bus was not able to progress due to crowds gathered on the streets, Claudio âChiqui' Tapia, the president of the Argentine Football Association said on Tuesday.
   
      "They won't let us go to greet all the people who were at the Obelisk, the same security agencies that escorted us, won't allow us to move forward," Tapia said.
   
      "A thousand apologies on behalf of all the champion players."
   
      The players were flown over the Obelisk and other areas and then flown back to the AFA training site in Ezeiza, outside of Buenos Aires, police said.
   
      State-owned TÃ©lam news agency reported that four million people came out to see the parade in Buenos Aires, citing police. 
   
      According to Argentine outlet InfoFunes, Messi and Ãngel Di MarÃ­a flew back to their districts in their native city of Rosario, Sante Fe province, by helicopter after arriving by plane to Rosario's local airport.
   
      Messi eventually arrived at his house by car to be greeted by a huge crowd of  fans celebrating his triumphant return, chanting "Dale CampeÃ³n, Dale CampeÃ³n" â "Let's go champion."
   
      Fellow Santa Fe natives Scaloni and forward Ãngel Correa also flew back, but InfoFunes reported this was via a late airplane flight.
   
      Tuesday had been declared a national holiday in Argentina following the team's thrilling penalty shootout victory over France in Qatar on Sunday. 
   
      The team's highly-anticipated return continues several days of celebration across the country , following Argentina's World Cup success
   
      Superstars Messi and Kylian MbappÃ© faced off on the pitch, in what has widely been called the greatest World Cup final of all time. 
   
      MbappÃ© was defending France's 2018 win at the tournament in Russia, while 35-year-old Messi was playing in what may be his final World Cup match, looking to claim the trophy which had eluded him for so long.
   
      Argentina took an early lead in the first half through a Messi penalty and a wonderful counterattacking goal from Di Maria, before France roared back in the second half with two MbappÃ© goals that forced the match into extra time. 
   
      Messi scored his second goal of the match to restore his team's lead â but MbappÃ© netted a second penalty to grab his hat-trick and take the final to a penalty shootout, which ended with triumph for Argentina after France missed two of its spot kicks.

      Boris Becker: Tennis great says a prison inmate tried to kill him while in UK jail
    
**************************
 
      Boris Becker says a prison "inmate tried to kill" him during the tennis great's incarceration in a British jail during an interview that was aired Tuesday by German broadcaster Sat 1.
   
      The inmate at Huntercombe prison, who Becker calls John, had been in prison for over 16 years, for killing two people when he was 18.
   
      Becker claimed that John was unhappy with the German's friendship with Black inmates and on one occasion threatened to sexually assault him. John had verbally explained what physical harm he would do to him. 
   
      "I was shaking so bad," Becker said when recalling the confrontation. "I shouted loudly and immediately the inmates came out and threatened him," added the 55-year-old former tennis star.
   
      According to Becker, a group of about 10 prisoners, predominately Black, came to intervene and protect him when he screamed for help. The prisoners arrived and told John to leave immediately or else he would be beaten.
   
      "He was dangerous. He couldn't understand why I was so connected with Black prisoners," said Becker.
   
      "Prison world is a bit different," added Becker, describing how John later "asked him for forgiveness" and an opportunity to reconcile. "I hugged him and told him I had great respect for him."
   
      In April, Becker was found guilty of four charges relating to his 2017 bankruptcy case under the Insolvency Act and was sentenced by Judge Deborah Taylor at Southwark Crown Court to two-and-a-half-years in April.
   
      In London's Wandsworth prison, where Becker spent the first weeks after his conviction, the 55-year-old said a fellow inmate tried to blackmail him and "wanted my money."
   
      Once again he says fellow inmates had protected him from any physical harm.
   
      The UK's Prison and Probation Service did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. 
   
      Becker also revealed several prominent friends â including Liverpool manager JÃ¼rgen Klopp â wanted to visit him in prison.
   
      "I am quite good friends with JÃ¼rgen Klopp," said Becker, who was told by prison authorities that the Liverpool manager "is not allowed to visit you because he is too well known. We are afraid for his safety, and we don't want the hype."  
   
      Liverpool did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.
   
      The former world No. 1 men's tennis player is now in Germany after serving eight months in prison.
   
      "In prison, you are a nobody. You are just a number. Mine was A2923EV," Becker told German broadcaster Sat 1's Steven GÃ¤tjen, according to the tabloid Bild.
   
      "And they don't give a sh*t who you are,"  added Becker, who was originally due to serve half his sentence in jail.
   
      "I think I have rediscovered the person in me that I once was," Becker told GÃ¤tjen.
   
      "I have learned a hard lesson, a very expensive one, a very painful one. But the whole thing has taught me something important and good. And some things happen for a reason," Becker added.
   
      The time in prison made Becker "really reflect on his life," GÃ¤tjen said. "You have to realize: Boris Becker has been in the spotlight since he was 17 years old. 
   
      "And then suddenly he's locked up, can't go out, only gets visits twice a month, is forced to fit into a strict prison system. I definitely had the impression that this experience really took a toll on him."
   
      Becker spent his first weeks behind bars in Wandsworth. Becker told GÃ¤tjen that he was "very afraid of ending up in a collective cell." 
   
      According to GÃ¤tjen, Becker was alone for the "first four days without contact with the outside world and was locked in his cell around the clock, with one hour of exit per day."
   
      The German made tennis history when he won Wimbledon aged 17 in 1985 and went on to win five more grand slam titles over the next 11 years.
   
      He remained active in the tennis world since retiring from the sport, notably as the coach of Novak Djokovic and through frequent media appearances as a commentator and pundit.
   
      At Becker's court case in April, the six-time grand slam champion was accused of "playing the system with bad faith" by concealing and transferring assets, and had deprived creditors of more than Â£2 million ($2.51 million) in assets.
   
      Becker previously denied all the charges, saying he had cooperated with bankruptcy proceedings, according to Reuters.

      Xiaomi layoffs: Thousands of tech jobs cut as Chinaâs unemployment crisis deepens

            Latest Market News 
	

 
      Xiaomi, one of the world's largest smartphone makers, has begun layoffs in China at a time when the world's second largest economy is grappling with an enormous unemployment crisis. 
   
      The Chinese company's decision to slash jobs comes soon after tech giants across the world, including Meta and Twitter, have laid off thousands of workers.
   
      The Beijing-based firm recently conducted a "routine personnel optimization and organizational streamlining," a Xiaomi spokesperson told CNN. The measure affects less than 10% of its total workforce, the person added.
   
      While the company did not share any other details, multiple state media outlets in China have reported this week that Xiaomi would cut thousands of jobs across multiple departments, including its smartphone and internet business units. 
   
      The company has already made significant cuts earlier this year. In the first nine months of 2022, Xiaomi reduced its workforce by nearly 1,900, according to its financial documents. By the end of September, it had around 35,000 full-time employees, most of whom were based in China.
   
      The company's revenue fell nearly 10% in the third quarter of this year from a year earlier, hurt by China's Covid restrictions and softening global demand for electronics. Sales from smartphones, which account for 60% of its revenue, dropped 11%. 
   
      
      1 in 5 of China's urban youth are unemployed. That's a huge headache for Xi Jinping
     
      The layoffs at the Chinese smartphone giant come at a time when the country is struggling with mounting economic challenges.
   
      Nearly three years of stringent pandemic restrictions have disrupted factory and consumer activities, hitting small businesses particularly hard.
   
      The urban unemployment rate, the broadest official measure of jobs, rose to 5.7% in November, the highest in six months, according to most recent government statistics. 
   
      Job prospects for young people are especially gloomy. The jobless rate for those aged 16 to 24 reached 17.1% in November, hovering near July's record level of 19.9%.
   
      The situation could become worse next year, as 11.6 million college graduates are expected to enter the job market â a fresh record, according to the education ministry last month.
   
      
      China's tech layoffs could become a self-inflicted headache for Xi 
     
      China's official measures of unemployment do not break down data by industry, but company results and private surveys suggest that jobs are being lost across the economy, and perhaps nowhere is the crisis more visible than in the tech sector.
   
      The once freewheeling industry has taken a deep hit from Beijing's effort to crackdown on internet giants, with companies like Alibaba
            
                (BABA) and Tencent
            
                (TCEHY) posting zero growth or even contraction in revenue for the first time in decades.
   
      Alibaba slashed its workforce by more than 15,000 in the first nine months of this year, and Tencent laid off about 4,000 employees during the same time period, according to CNN's calculations.
   
      The layoffs could be a big headache for the government, which says preventing job losses will be its top policy priority for next year.
   
      China has witnessed some unprecedented protests in recent months. In November, street demonstrations erupted in multiple cities in a rare show of public anger against the country's stringent zero-Covid policy, which was abruptly reversed in early December.
   
      In July, disgruntled home buyers across the country threatened to stop repaying mortgages for unfinished home projects. Violent clashes also erupted in central China earlier this year, as thousands of depositors couldn't access their savings at several rural banks in the region.

      Taliban suspend university education for women in Afghanistan
    
**************************
 
      The Taliban government has suspended university education for all female students in Afghanistan, the latest step in its brutal clampdown on the rights and freedoms of Afghan women. 
   
      A spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Higher Education confirmed the suspension to CNN on Tuesday. A letter published by the education ministry said the decision was made in a cabinet meeting and the order will go into effect immediately.
   
      Girls were barred from returning to secondary schools in March, after the Taliban ordered schools for girls to shut just hours after they were due to reopen following months long closures imposed after the Taliban takeover in August 2021.
   
      Human Rights Watch criticized the ban on Tuesday, calling it a "shameful decision that violates the right to education for women and girls in Afghanistan."
   
      "The Taliban are making it clear every day that they don't respect the fundamental rights of Afghans, especially women," the rights watchdog said in a statement. 
   
      The US condemns "the Taliban's indefensible decision to ban women from universities," State Department spokesperson Ned Price said during a Tuesday briefing. 
   
      The Taliban's recent decision, he said, will "have significant consequences for the Taliban and will further alienate the Taliban from the international community and deny them the legitimacy they desire."
   
      
      How one family's struggle illustrates problems with the program meant to help Afghans who helped the US
     
      The March closure of secondary schools to girls had a "significant impact" on US engagement with Taliban representatives, Price added.
   
      "With the implementation of this decree, half of the Afghan population will soon be unable to access education beyond primary school," he said.
   
      US Ambassador Robert Wood, the alternate representative for special political affairs, earlier reiterated those criticisms, telling a United Nations' Security Council briefing that the "Taliban cannot expect to be a legitimate member of the international community until they respect the rights of all Afghans, especially the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls."
   
      The Taliban, which ruled over Afghanistan from 1996 until 2001, when the US-led invasion forced the group from power, have historically treated women as second-class citizens, subjecting them to violence, forced marriages and a near-invisible presence in the country.
   
      After seizing power in Afghanistan last year, the Taliban attempted to project a more moderate image to gain international support. 
   
      But while it has has made numerous promises to the international community that it would protect the rights of women and girls, the Taliban has been doing the opposite, systematically clamping down on their rights and freedoms.
   
      Women in Afghanistan can no longer work in most sectors, require a male guardian for long-distance travel and have been ordered to cover their faces in public. 
   
      They have also imposed limits on girls' education, banning women from certain workplaces as they stripped away rights they had fought tirelessly for over the last two decades.
   
      In November, Afghan women prevented from entering amusement parks in Kabul as the government announced restrictions on women being able to access public parks, Reuters reports.

      Japan just delivered a lump of coal to investors across the globe

            Latest Market News 
	

 
  A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign upÂ right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.
 
      Wall Street just received a big lump of Christmas coal. 
   
      A surprise announcement from the Bank of Japan sent investors spinning and global markets reeling on Tuesday. The country's central bank signaled that it would reverse two decades of policy precedent and begin to move away from loose monetary policy intended to keep wages and prices high. 
   
      The move, which opens the door to future rate hikes, stoked investors' fears that the global war on inflation is still roaring on and that recession is unavoidable. 
   
      What's happening: The theme of 2022 has been higher interest rates. Over 90% of central banks have hiked rates this year, making the (mostly) globally coordinated effort to fight persistent inflation unprecedented, according to LPL Financial. There has, however, been one notable exception to the rule: Japan. 
   
      That all changed this week. The Japanese Central Bank loosened the yield on its 10-year government bonds from 0.25% to 0.5%. At the same time, the bank will increase its monthly bond purchases to $67 billion from around $55 billion.
   
      The move sent the yen soaring to a four-month high against the US dollar, its largest one-day jump in 24 years and wreaked havoc on global stock and bond trading. 
   
      Why it matters: Japanese rates remain low, but Tuesday's move means that the world's third-largest economy now sees inflation as a risk. 
   
      That's a big change: Japan had been keeping inflation low for decades in efforts to fight a prolonged strong yen and deflationary recession that  stagnated the Japanese economy. Lately, the country has felt the impacts of an aging and falling population which has kept consumer demand and inflation low.
   
      The BOJ policy minutes noted the shift. Core consumer price rises are now around 3.5%, still lower than in the United States and Europe but an increase from the previous statement. The central bank said that inflation expectations have risen.  
   
      Japan's is the last major central bank to keep rates negative and this signals that it could be shifting its stance. That heightens investor expectations for more upsetting inflation news in 2023 and increased market volatility. They worry that Japan's shift away from ultra-low rates will be the final nail in the coffin of the easy money era and will once again increase global bond yields. 
   
      "This BOJ move (like the removal of any other "peg") along with the potential for more to come, supports volatility [in the year ahead]," wrote Bruno Braizinha and Mark Cabana, rates strategists at Bank of America. 
   
      In a news briefing, BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda said it was "too early to consider reviewing or exiting" its current easing policies, but that didn't stop markets from reacting. 
   
      "Whatever the BOJ calls this, it is a step toward an exit," said Masamichi Adachi, chief Japan economist at UBS Securities. "This opens a door for a possible rate hike in 2023 under a new governorship."
   
      Federal regulators fined Wells Fargo a record $1.7 billion on Tuesday for multiple years of "widespread mismanagement" that they say harmed over 16 million consumer accounts, reports my colleague Matt Egan. 
   
      Wells Fargo's "illegal activity" included repeatedly misapplying loan payments, wrongfully foreclosing on homes, illegally repossessing vehicles, incorrectly assessing fees and interest and charging surprise overdraft fees, according to the The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
   
      "Wells Fargo's rinse-repeat cycle of violating the law has harmed millions of American families," Rohit Chopra, the CFPB's director, said in a statement.
   
      More to come: During a call with reporters, Chopra said the new settlement should not be read as a signal that "Wells Fargo has moved past its long-standing problems or that the CFPB's work is done here."
   
      For instance, Chopra noted that the settlement does not provide immunity for individuals at Wells Fargo, and the agency recognizes the $3.7 billion in fines and restitution will not fix the bank's problems.
   
      In a statement, Wells Fargo emphasized that the broad-reaching settlement with the CFPB resolves multiple matters, most of which have been "outstanding for several years." The bank said the required actions are "already substantially complete."
   
      "We and our regulators have identified a series of unacceptable practices that we have been working systematically to change and provide customer remediation where warranted," Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said in the statement. "This far-reaching agreement is an important milestone in our work to transform the operating practices at Wells Fargo and to put these issues behind us."
   
      3M, the conglomerate behind Post-It notes and Scotch tape, has announced that they will stop making hazordous "forever" chemicalsâ¦ in a few years.
   
      The controversial chemicals, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), are found in hundreds of household items and used to make coatings and products that can repel water, grease, heat and oil. The most recent science suggests that these chemicals are much more hazardous to human health than scientists had initially thought and probably more dangerous at levels thousands of times lower than previously believed, reports my colleague Jordan Valinksy.  
   
      In a statement Tuesday, 3M said its decision to end the chemicals' production by 2025 is "based on careful consideration and a thorough evaluation of the evolving external landscape."
   
      The Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposal earlier this year to label "forever chemicals" as hazardous substances. California also announced a lawsuit recently to recoup the clean-up costs from PFAS.
   
      "While PFAS can be safely made and used, we also see an opportunity to lead in a rapidly evolving external regulatory and business landscape to make the greatest impact for those we serve," said 3M CEO Mike Roman in a statement. "This action is another example of how we are positioning 3M for continued sustainable growth by optimizing our portfolio, innovating for our customers, and delivering long-term value for our shareholders."
   
      The company expects to take a financial hit of about $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion over the next few years because of the PFAS discontinuation. Yet 3M (MMM) said PFAS represents a "small portion" of its revenue.
   
      3M stock is down about 32% year-to-date.

      Opinion: The backlash against âThe Whaleâ is telling us all something important
    
**************************
 
  Editor's Note: Sara Stewart is a film and culture writer who lives in western Pennsylvania. The views expressed here are solely the author's own. View more opinion articles on CNN.
 
      As Darren Aronofsky's "The Whale" â which has been in select theaters â opens in theaters around the country this week, the film could become a powerful empathy generator. Just perhaps not in the way it was intended.   
   
      The film, which has garnered significant praise even as it's prompted notable controversy, stars Brendan Fraser as Charlie, a 600-pound gay man slowly eating himself to death. It's adapted from a play of the same name by Samuel D. Hunter, and one of its most-discussed features has been the fat suit Fraser wears. 
   
      The film has been a flashpoint for controversy since it debuted at the Venice Film Festival this summer. While critics and the public seem nearly unanimous in their desire for nice guy Fraser to get all the awards for his dedicated performance, a mounting chorus has described the film's tone and content as fatphobic. 
   
      I have not yet seen "The Whale," as I'm not located in one of the two cities it's been playing in prior to its expanded release this week.  Given the acclaim the film's received and my desire to see Fraser thrive after what he's been through, I had originally planned to see it when I could. But after spending some time reading and listening to how harmful fat people say the portrayal is to them, I'm taking another look.   
   
      By many accounts, the film plays Charlie's weight as an absolute tragedy and a visual horror show. 
   
      "Aronofsky turns up the foley audio whenever Charlie is eating, to emphasize the wet sound of lips smacking together. He plays ominous music under these sequences, so we know Charlie's doing something very bad indeed," wrote Katie Rife in Polygon. "In case viewers still don't get that they're supposed to find him disgusting, he recites an essay about âMoby-Dick' and how a whale is âa poor big animal' with no feelings."  
   
      
      Brendan Fraser's standout performance can't keep 'The Whale' afloat
     
      From the beginning, the film apparently humiliates Charlie abjectly: He's shown nearly dying from a heart attack while masturbating to porn. "It was crystal clear that Mr. Hunter and Mr. Aronofsky considered fatness to be the ultimate human failure," asserted Roxane Gay in the New York Times, "something despicable, to be avoided at all costs."  
   
      So maybe it's a good occasion to devote some effort to listening to, reading and amplifying voices from the fat community regarding their thoughts on "The Whale."  
   
      It's not like there's any dearth of commentary about how bad being fat is, from official government warnings to comedians like Ricky Gervais who've made it one of their pet subjects. In a more novel development, though, early news of "The Whale" this year coincided with an uptick in discourse around both fat acceptance and open criticism of Hollywood's history of generally horrific portrayals of fatness, most prominently in its use of the fat suit. Earlier this year, Sarah Paulson and Emma Thompson came under fire for wearing prosthetic body suits, the former as Linda Tripp in "Impeachment: American Crime Story," and the latter as Miss Trunchbull in Netflix's "Matilda."

      Hunter, who also wrote the film, told Entertainment Weekly, "I understand why people have some of those reactions because, look, the history of portraying people suffering with obesity in cinema is not good," but argued that the film is an "invitation" to "be with" Charlie. For viewers who "do take that invitation and go inside," he said "I think you'll find that this is the diametric opposite of the way obesity has traditionally been portrayed and dealt with in cinema."   
   
      To me, the best thing that could come out of all the publicity surrounding "The Whale" is the centering of the opinions of fat people on the film. Are they planning to see "The Whale"? What are other people saying to them about the movie? How will this affect them, and the way we all think about fatness? And shouldn't those of us who haven't had that lived experience maybe justâ¦ shut the F up?
   
      Aubrey Gordon, author of the forthcoming book "âYou Just Need to Lose Weight' and 19 Other Myths About Fat People" and co-host of the excellent podcast "Maintenance Phase," has been a crucial voice on the subject. In a 2021 episode of the show, she examined the obesity epidemic, including the ways in which research data has been misused over the past two decades to gin up a moral panic about fatness.  
   
      For me, Gordon and her co-host, Michael Hobbes, have been instrumental in evolving the way I process stories and information (and misinformation) about weight, "wellness," and the loudest cultural voices speaking about health and lifestyle. Their episode on Dr. Oz is a smart, hilarious jumping-in point. 
   
      
      The show flipping the script on 'fat' and 'millennial' 
     
      In discussing the discourse around "The Whale" on Twitter, Gordon pointed to another Hollywood movie that involved a fat suit: 2001's "Shallow Hal," the Farrelly brothers comedy whose running gag is that a guy (Jack Black) is hypnotized into believing a very fat woman (Gwyneth Paltrow, wearing the suit) is beautiful.  
   
      When accused of being fatphobic, the filmmakers of "Shallow Hal" said that the "movie's heart is in the right place." That, said Gordon on Twitter, is beside the point. "It's deeply telling & extraordinarily disheartening that so many people take thin creators saying âwe didn't mean to hurt fat people' as saying they somehow DIDN'T or CAN'T hurt fat people. It's deeply telling & extraordinarily disheartening that, after 20+ yrs, that still works."
   
      In the release of "The Whale," she continued, "so much of the discourse this time around consists of fat people saying âthis is going to make life harder for me' and the response from people who aren't fat is largely âno, it's humanizing you.' I would argue that's our call to make." 
   
      
      Opinion: What I learned from anorexia the second time around
     
      Guy Branum, an actor, TV host and comedian who had a role in the recent romantic comedy "Bros," has also been outspoken about his objections to "The Whale" and its portrayal of fat people. In an interview with NPR's Glen Weldon, he noted Aronofsky's citing health risks on set as his reason for putting an actor in a fat suit, rather than just casting a bigger actor. "I desperately pleaded with Nick Stoller, the director of âBros,' to take out a full page ad in Variety attesting to the fact that he had worked with me for four months," he told Weldon, "and I did not explode once on set from fatness." 
   
      Branum has also shared his experience of reading the play the film is based on: "Part of me hoped it might be good, insightful about a life like mine. Instead it was a sad, pathetic story of a sad, pathetic man. I got sad for the main character, Charlie, and how little the author's imagination offered his life, trapped in a bad apartment, eating fried chicken endlessly," Branum wrote on Instagram, following it up with a description of taking the play on trips with him so it might enjoy a little happiness for a change. 
   
      Critic Sean Donovan, who identifies as fat and queer, wrote movingly of his experience watching the film, particularly his dismay at its "soap opera" plotting around Charlie's martyrish refusal to seek medical treatment so he can leave all his money to his daughter (Sadie Sink), who hates him.  
   
      As Donovan pointed out, there are other, more plausible reasons a man like Charlie might avoid hospitals: "The shame felt in medical spaces is a real danger to queer and fat populations, causing us to avoid them precisely when they are the most needed. These contexts never come up in âThe Whale,' to its detriment, as they could have invested the film with the breath of true challenges and barriers facing queer and fat people in the world." 
   
      Donovan's assertions are backed up by Scientific American, whose weight stigma reporter Virginia Sole-Smith has covered the many ways in which medicine is tainted by anti-fat bias, from doctors who admit they're "disgusted" by overweight patients to the "obesity paradox," which refers to findings that in some cases, "fat people [are] not dying of heart disease like we're always told they will," and that in fact being physically active is more important for heart health than how big your body is. 
   
      It's in Aronofsky's failure to engage any of these viewpoints â and he's done a lot of talking about the movie since its release  â that he makes clear how little connection there is between "The Whale" and living, breathing fat people. 
   
     
      So instead of seeing this film I'm making plans to read and listen to writers who are working to change the perception and portrayal of fat people. In addition to Gordon's book and podcast, there is critic Clarkisha Kent's memoir "Fat Off, Fat On: A Big Bitch Manifesto," coming out next March, and journalist and author Evette Dionne's new book "Weightless: Making Space for My Resilient Body and Soul." Also worth a read: "Shrill," by Lindy West (which later became an Aidy Bryant-starring TV show), a memoir that became an instant classic when it published in 2016. 
   
      I think West should have the last word here, from her 2011 essay on fat-shaming, "Hello, I Am Fat." Her words describe why, despite whatever may be great about "The Whale," I don't want to see it.
   
      "This is what's behind this entire thingâit's not about âhealth,' it's about âeeeewwwww.' You think fat people are icky. Eeeewww, a fat person might touch you on a plane. With their fat!â¦ And sorry, I reject your eeeeeewwww."

      What is a bomb cyclone? Hereâs what you need to know
    
**************************
 
      Bomb. It's not a word you can say on an airplane (cue Ben Stiller). You also have to be careful when using it to describe a storm system.
   
      But the term "bomb cyclone" does pop up from time to time in weather stories. Here's what it means: 
   
      Bomb cyclone is a term given to a rapidly strengthening storm that fulfills one important criterion. Generally, pressure must drop 24 millibars (a unit of pressure) within 24 hours.
   
      However, that benchmark is also based on the latitude of the storm. So, the millibar requirement can change depending on where the storm forms.  
   
      The term can be traced back to a meteorological research paper published in a 1980 edition of Monthly Weather Review.
   
      Its authors, MIT meteorologists Fred Sanders and John Gyakum, built upon work by Swedish meteorology researcher Tor Bergeron, who had initially defined "rapidly deepening" storms as those that met the 24 millibars-in-24 hours criterion. 
   
      But Bergeron was way up in Scandinavia, where storms strengthen much quicker because of the latitude (remember the Coriolis effect?).
   
      Sanders and Gyakum adjusted the ground rules to vary based on latitude. They added the term "bomb" because of the explosive power that these storms derive from rapid pressure drops (though Gyakum reportedly doesn't use that word anymore because of its reference to weaponry).
   
      Since you read down this far, I feel obligated to give you the actual equation â and if you love it, perhaps you should consider pursuing a career in meteorology!
   
      To calculate the pressure drop needed for a bomb cyclone, you take the sine of the latitude where the low pressure is located and divide it by the sine of 60 degrees (and you thought you would never use trigonometry). 
   
      Why 60 degrees? That's the latitude where Bergeron was when he developed the initial scale. 
   
      Once you do the calculation, multiply that result by 24, and that is the number of millibars the storm's pressure must drop to officially qualify it as a bomb cyclone at the given latitude.

      Why the future of our cities might be headed underground
    
**************************
 
      There is a megaproject underway that's not so much breaking new ground, as burrowing beneath it. In Singapore, a series of extensive tunnels are being bored into the soil some 60 meters down â below subterranean shopping malls and even the city's metro.
   
      Originally envisioned in the mid-1990s, the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS) is an underground "superhighway" that could provide a blueprint for other cities around the world. It's all part of a masterplan to conserve two precious resources: space and water.
   
      "We were faced with the challenges of a rising population and also increasing developments for industries," said Woo Lai Lynn, chief engineer for the project, which is run by PUB, the national water agency. "With this added demand, we couldn't keep on relying on expanding the existing wastewater infrastructure. We had to find a solution that was more sustainable and gave us greater resilience for our water supply."
   
      The first phase, which finished in 2008 and cost an estimated 3.4 billion Singapore dollars ($2.5 billion), included 48 kilometers of deep sewer tunnels and a new centralized water reclamation plant. Phase two broke ground in November 2017 and is expected to be complete by 2026, said Woo.
   
      Once finished, roughly 200 kilometers of tunnels will transport wastewater to underground treatment plants. Using massive tunnel boring machines, crews are descending underground to drill the tunnels and install a network of pipes.
   
      "The uncertainties excite me the most with this project," said Woo. "You can't quite tell what you're going to encounter underground."
   
      The complete DTSS project will free up around 150 hectares of land above ground, according to PUB. The agency has implemented new technology based on what it learned during the first phase â including a special type of concrete that is resistant to microbiological-induced corrosion, Woo said, and embedding fiber optic cables within the tunnel linings to monitor structural integrity without needing to send as many crews underground.
   
      Not only will it help with the water supply by treating up to two million cubic meters of wastewater per day, according to Woo, but it will continue to provide critical information and lessons about subterranean development for Singapore and beyond.
   
      With limited land available, the country has started utilizing its underground space for more than just transport over the last decade.
   
      JTC, a government agency responsible for industrial development, is storing liquid hydrocarbons such as crude oil in five massive underground caverns. Known as the Jurong Rock Caverns, they hold the equivalent of 600 Olympic-sized swimming pools, according to JTC â all to free up precious land above.
   
      As part of the underground master plan, Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) commissioned Arup, an independent firm of engineers, designers and planners, to evaluate and create a benchmarking study of underground space development. One of the key takeaways was a focus on sustainability "very early" in these projects, said Peter Stones, associate engineer at Arup and one of the authors of the report.
   
      "Space is a resource, and in our urban cities, it's a scarce resource, so we need to manage and consume that resource in a sustainable way," he said. "That means having established practices around planning and managing those spaces," versus the "ad hoc" way underground space has been developed in most cities around the world.
   
      By getting engineers crucial information before starting a project, Stones added, they can mitigate risks and improve the longevity and sustainability of subterranean development. That knowledge can also be applied to urban planning and development above ground.
   
      Singapore is not the first place to explore using its underground space.
   
      Helsinki, the Finnish capital, has an expansive underground development â complete with subterranean church and swimming pool â originally intended as a space to house the city's entire population in the event of a nuclear attack. In Canada, Montreal has one of the world's largest underground pedestrian networks, spanning more than 30 kilometers.
   
      
      Are microcars the smaller, greener future of urban driving?
     
      A design firm in Mexico City even developed the concept of "The Earthscraper," an inverted, underground skyscraper.
   
      Though there is historical precedent, with ancient subterranean cities in places such as Spain and Turkey, getting humans to actually live underground today remains a tougher sell.
   
      "We see an interesting layer cake of the underground space development," said Stones, "where those human-centered uses are really prioritized at the shallowest levels, and the deeper levels are reserved for those uses which require less human contact." 
   
      "Globally as our cities grow in terms of population (and) density â¦ we are going to see more underground space development," he added. "I envisage a future where the topside is prioritized for people, for ecology, for nature â and underground space can service that topside through infrastructure and through other uses."

      The best and worst TV endings of 2022, from âBetter Call Saulâ to âKilling Eveâ
    
**************************
 
      To win a gold medal in Olympic sports like diving or gymnastics, the key last step is to stick the landing. That's also true for TV series, which, however popular they might have been at their apex, can leave a sour aftertaste if they mess up their finales.
   
      This year brought a mixed bag of finishes, from AMC's "Better Call Saul" â which put a cherry on top of its splendid run â to Showtime's "Ray Donovan," which after ending abruptly in 2020 presented a dreary movie intended to provide its audience a belated degree of closure.
   
      A few disclaimers: This isn't a comprehensive list, with "His Dark Materials," "The Good Fight" and "Better Things" among the other shows â some notable, others less so â that ended their runs this year. Also, entries are limited to programs where the producers knew they were coming to an end and could plan accordingly, thus excluding something like "Westworld," which was canceled after its fourth season and deprived the opportunity to craft an ending â not, frankly, that it would have likely mattered much given its confusing creative spiral.
   
      From top to bottom, then, here are some of the series that said goodbye in 2022, and whether their routines wowed the judges (OK, this particular judge).
   
      "Better Call Saul" (AMC, August 16): All those teases of a black-and-white future finally came together as the "Breaking Bad" spinoff reached its conclusion, which included weaving in some of the original characters to help say goodbye. Given the suspense that always existed about what separated Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) from Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn), the understated payoff, and Saul's act of contrition, seemed as pitch perfect as most of what preceded it.
   
      "Ozark" (Netflix, April 29): A family that crimes together apparently stays together, as the Byrdes left behind plenty of collateral damage in their final dangerous arc, and in the process brought their children into what had become the family business. A beautifully acted series from start to finish, with Jason Bateman and Laura Linney leading the way.
   
      "This is Us" (NBC, May 24): The unabashedly sentimental and romantic finale nicely reflected the tone of the show throughout its run, which is something to which finales should always aspire. It also created a strong showcase for Mandy Moore, while capturing the challenges of caring for and saying goodbye to an aging parent.
   
      "Atlanta" (FX, November 10): Anyone expecting some kind of closure clearly wasn't paying attention to this long-delayed final season, which was even more lyrical, scattered and occasionally surreal than those leading up to it. Still, the Donald Glover series went out entirely on its own terms, which was interesting simply on that level, yielding great moments along the way more than a cohesive whole.
   
      "Black-ish" (ABC, April 19): The long-running ABC sitcom featured plenty of memorable episodes during its eight-season run. The ambitious finale wasn't necessarily one of them, but after everything from a New Orleans-style funeral to a cameo by gymnast Simon Biles, it sweetly closed with the reminder that sitcoms might end, but life goes on. Like "The Walking Dead" (see below), the show wasn't helped by the determination to spin it off with "grown-ish" and "mixed-ish," another example of franchise fatigue.
   
      "After Life" (Netflix, January 14): Ricky Gervais' melancholy series about dealing with grief cut against the grain by choosing a less-uplifting finish than most movies and TV devoted to this theme, accepting that not everyone can happily move on after experiencing tragedy. The thoughtful payoff couldn't elevate this to the level of "The Office" and "Extras" co-creator's top-tier efforts.
   
      "Grace and Frankie" and "Dead to Me" (Netflix, April 29 and November 17): Two Netflix shows about the unlikely friendships between two very different women said goodbye, with the former providing a nifty showcase for older stars, beginning with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, while ending with a bit of whimper after seven seasons. Both flirted with death in their last seasons, as "Dead to Me" centered on the bond between Jen (Christina Applegate) and Judy (Linda Cardellini), even if the twists leading up to it, starting with the whole James Marsden twin thing, had begun to grow a bit tedious.
   
      "The Walking Dead" (AMC, November 21): The main problem with the ending of this AMC staple is that it really wasn't an ending at all, as all those promos for spinoff series featuring prominent characters made clear. Mostly, it felt like an OK way to complete the season after the drawn-out Commonwealth plot. Beyond that, it's basically an intermission on the "Dead" franchise, in part because the network is so heavily invested in this "zombie-verse" it has to keep lurching onward.
   
      "Ray Donovan: The Movie" (Showtime, January 14): After abruptly ending in 2020, this gritty Showtime drama sought to tie up loose ends with a movie, relying on an extensive flashback that only marginally added to the story. Liev Schreiber's Ray wielded a mean bat in his glory days, but this last trip to the plate (unlike "Dexter: New Blood," which premiered in 2021 but didn't officially end until this year, making the most of its limited-series do-over) constituted a swing and a miss.
   
      "Killing Eve" (BBC America, April 10): Setting aside the tired nature of the "Bury your gays" trope, this once-addictive series concluded with an episode that was as chaotic as it was unsatisfying. Having burned brightly at first, the spy dramedy should be remembered for its initial cat-and-mouse game involving the office-bound analyst Eve (Sandra Oh) and the accomplished assassin Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and not incidentally, turning the then-unknown Comer into a bankable star.

      Jordan Spieth on the joy of trash-talking Tiger Woods
    
**************************
 
      It's one of sport's most unfamiliar sights â Tiger Woods standing idly by as his opponents are crowned winners.
   
      Alongside Rory McIlroy, Woods had just fallen to an emphatic defeat in the seventh edition of The Match to golf's dynamic duo and long-time friends â Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas.
   
      Cross-armed, the 15-time major winner watched on as the victorious pair were presented with commemorative bracelets. All night on December 10, trash talk had rained down like bullets under the lights at Florida's Pelican Club, but Spieth had one left in the chamber.
   
      "The joy out of getting this does not match the joy of standing here with Tiger just being so upset that he has to stand here for this," a giggling Spieth jabbed.
   
      Woods' composed expression cracked, a wide smile breaking out across the 46-year-old's face followed by a shake of the head. 
   
      
      Seeing double: Tiger Woods and son Charlie tee off in perfect symmetry wearing famous Sunday red
     
      Woods alone boasted six more majors and 31 more PGA titles than the three greats of the game beside him combined, a mind-blowing disparity that Spieth was well aware of. Yet, it was this very gap that made the final blow that much more satisfying, the Dallas-born golfer explained.
   
      "He's in a position that he doesn't even need to justify fighting back," Spieth told CNN.
   
      "He laughs, he's pissed off. He's pretty much like, âAll right, go home kid.' That's what I got out of that smile.
   
      "And for me, it was sarcasm. He's a guy who you never think about seeing stick around and have to sit there while somebody else won. Because one, he didn't lose very often, and two, the few times he did, I'm sure he was very far away from wherever the award ceremony was."
   
      As is custom, the back-and-forth between the mic'd up players and the commentary team helped drive the friendly competitive atmosphere of the event, which raised funds for relief efforts in Florida in the wake of Hurricane Ian in October.
   
      At times, the relentless verbal warfare waged between Thomas and NBA legend Charles Barkley took center stage over the golf itself, a role reversal that Spieth had initially been anxious to take on.
   
      "I was super nervous to get going because it was a new role â we had to entertain," Spieth admitted.
   
      "It was kind of an excited anxiousness, like super excited to get going, not really knowing what to expect.
   
      "Us four together, we've all had a pretty good relationship â¦ bringing out a lot of people and a lot of interest, I think that really helped [us] get comfortable."
   
      And based on the pair's track record, there is nobody Spieth is more comfortable around than Thomas.
   
      The long-time friends became only the third pair in history to go undefeated in the first four rounds of the Presidents Cup in September, as a flawless 5-0-0 run extended their combined record across President Cups and Ryder Cups to 8-2-0.

      "We just have a lot of fun," Spieth said. 
   
      "It takes some of the pressure away when we're playing, because on a bad hole one of us will just be self-depreciating and the other will laugh, and all of a sudden you just get a little bit more comfortable. And on the good holes, we're hyping each other up, using phrases that are funny to he and I. 
   
      "Think of going out with your best buddy in a high-pressure situation. That has such benefit on the back end and being able to just feel super comfortable â it's kind of an addicting feeling."
   
      Victory at The Match put the icing on a strong year for Spieth, continuing his return to his best form.
   
      After bursting onto the scene with three major triumphs inside his first four years on Tour, a relative slump saw the former World No. 1 fall outside the top 50 for the first time since his historic rookie season in 2020.
   
      Yet after ending a 1,351-day trophy drought and finishing runner-up at The Open last year, Spieth has gone from strength to strength, adding his 13th Tour title in April and dazzling in a dominant Presidents Cup win to climb back inside the world's top 15. 
   
      Spieth believes a focus on mechanical work in his swing had led to a neglect of putting and chipping, but after finding balance, he is optimistic about achieving the consistency needed to hurdle his high benchmark; to be in firm contention for half the season's majors.
   
      "I always have the goal of trying to have a chance when I tee it up on Sunday to win at least two majors â that's where we're setting up to peak for," he said.
   
      "That doesn't mean I have to be in the lead, it means when I tee it up, I sit there and say, âIf I play my best golf, I will win this today.'"
